    Samples\enum.c

    This program demonstrates the use of the enum keyword in Dynamic
    C.  It also demonstrates ANSI escape sequences with the STDIO
    window so that various effects can be achieved.

    The enum construct allows the simple construction of identifiers
    that correspond to specific numbers.  These identifiers share the
    scope of the enum definition.  Note that enums are always of type
    int.  The initial identifier's value is 0 by default.  Each
    successive identifier's value is 1 more than the previous
    identifier by default.  At any time, an explicit constant value
    can used for an identifier.  There is no need for each value to
    be unique.

    Note also that enum identifiers are not lvalues--hence, you can
    not change them once they are defined.
