   slice01.c

   This example demonstrate the basic functionality of a slice statement
   It alternates incrementing two counters in a tight loop.  The first
   tight loop is allowed to run for 25 ticks and the second for 50 ticks.
   After each has had a chance to run the values of the counters are
   outputed to the stdio window and the process is repeated by the outside
   loop.

   The first number in the slice statement is the size of the stack.  It
   needs to be at least large enough for the worst case stack usage by
   the user program and interrupt routines.

   Notice the use of shared variables for counters.  This is _IMPORTANT_
   to insure the atomic updating of the values at the end of the
   increment operations.  If they were not shared variables it is possible
   that half of the long would be updated with the other half not updated.

   The expected behavior is that x is incremented about 1/2 as fast as y.
   This will not be exact because y has less overhead because it has 1/2
   as many context switches.  The lower the ticks the more overhead will
   influence the amount of work you can get done in each pass.
