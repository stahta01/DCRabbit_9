        RCM2200\EthCore1.c

        A basic contoller. This creates two 'devices' (lights), and two
        buttons to toggle them. Users can browse to the device, and change
        the status of the lights.  If you have the core plugged into the
        development board in the MASTER slot, the lights on the board will
        track the ones on the web page.  LED's are based on silkscreen labels.

        See "Samples\ZConsole\TcpConsole.c" for example of maintaining state
        across power-cycles.

        This program is based on the "samples/tcpip/http/ssi.c" and 
        "samples/RCM2100/EthCore1.c" sample programs.
