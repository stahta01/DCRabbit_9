	digOut.c

	This sample program is for the BL2100 series controllers.

	This program demonstrates the use of the high-current outputs configured
	as SINKING and SOURCING type outputs. The sample program requires the use
	the DEMO board that was provided in your development kit so you can see
	the LED's toggle ON/OFF via the high-current outputs.

	Attention!!!
	------------
	The high-current output OUT00 is being use to provide the power source to
	the DEMO board. And the sinking type outputs OUT01-OUT04 are being used to
	control the LEDS.

	Test Setup:
	-----------
	1. DEMO board jumper settings:
			- H1 remove all jumpers
			- H2 jumper pins 3-5
              jumper pins 4-6

	2. Connect a wire from the controller J4 GND, to the DEMO board
	   J1 GND.

	3. Connect a wire on the controller from J4 +RAW to J7 +K1 and +K2.

	4. Connect a wire from the controller J7 OUT00, to the DEMO board
	   J1 +K.

	5. Connect the following wires from the controller J7 to the DEMO
	   board J1:

	   	From OUT01 to LED1
	   	From OUT02 to LED2
	   	From OUT03 to LED3
	   	From OUT04 to LED4



   Note: This is going to power the LED's on the DEMO board. With the 3.3k
         ohm resistor in series with the LED, the LED's can withstand the
         full input voltage range for a BL2100 series controller.


	Test Instructions:
	------------------
	1. Connect LED1 - LED4 from the DEMO board to any 4 outputs on the
	   controller as in Test Setup above or choose from OUT01 - OUT15.

	2. Compile and run this program.

	3. The program will prompt you for your channel selection, select
	   Output Channel OUT00.

	4. After you have made the channel selection you'll be prompted to
	   select the logic level, set the OUT00 channel to a high logic
	   level.

	5. At this point your ready to start toggling the LEDS by selecting
	   selecting channels OUT01 - OUT04, and changing the logic level.

	6. To check other outputs use a voltmeter to verify that the channels
	   have changed to the level that you have set it to.
