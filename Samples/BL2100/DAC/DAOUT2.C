/***************************************************************************
	daout2.c
	
   This sample program is used with the BL2100 series controllers.
   
   This program demonstrates the use of both the DAC and the A/D converters.
   The user selects both the DAC and A/D channel to be used, then sets the
   DAC output voltage to be read by the A/D channel. All activity will be
   displayed in the STDIO window.

	!!!This program must be compiled to Flash.
	
   Instructions:
	1. Connect DAC0 or DAC1 to a A/D input channel 0 - 10.
	2. Compile and run this program.
	3. Follow the prompted directions of this program during execution.
