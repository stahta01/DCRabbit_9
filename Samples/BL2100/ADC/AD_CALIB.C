/***************************************************************************
	ad_calib.c

	This sample program is used with the BL2100 series controllers.

	This program demonstrates how to recalibrate an ADC channel using two
	known	voltages to generate two coefficients, gain and offset, which 
	will be rewritten	into user block data area. It will also continuously
	display the voltage that's being monitored.

	!!! Caution !!!
	1. Make sure that you don't exceed the voltage range of the A/D input channel.
	2. This program will overwrite the calibration constants set at the factory.
	3. This program must be compiled to Flash.
                      
	Instructions:
	-------------
	1. Connect a voltmeter to the output of the power supply that your using.

	2. Preset the voltage on the power supply to be within the voltage range
	of the A/D converter channel that your going to calibrate. For A/D
	channels 0 - 10 the input voltage range is -10 to +10 volts.

	3. Power-on the controller.
	
	4. Connect output of power supply to one of the A/D channels.

	5. Compile and run this program.

	6. Follow the calibration instructions	prompted from this program
	during execution.
	
	7. Vary the voltage (see above for voltage range) on a A/D channel,
	the voltage displayed in the STDIO window and the voltmeter should
	track each other.
