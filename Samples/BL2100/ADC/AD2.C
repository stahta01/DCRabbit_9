/***************************************************************************
	ad2.c
	
	This sample program is used the BL2100 series controllers.

	This program demonstrates how to access the A/D channels with the API
	anaInVolt function. With using the anaInVolt function the program
	will continuously display the voltage that is being monitored.

	!!!This program must be compiled to Flash.
	
	Instructions:
	-------------
	1. Connect a voltmeter to the output of the power supply that your
	going to use.

	2. Preset the voltage on the power supply to be within the voltage
	range of the A/D converter channel that your going to test. For A/D
	channels 0 - 10 the input voltage range is -10 to +10V or 0 to 10V
	depending on your controller.

	3. Power-on the controller.
	
	4. Connect the output of power supply to one of the A/D channels.

	5. Compile and run this program.

	6. Vary the voltage to the A/D channel, the voltage displayed in the
	STDIO	window and voltmeter should track each other.
