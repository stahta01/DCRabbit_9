	This sample program is used the BL2100 series controllers.

	This program demonstrates how to use the A/D low level driver. The
	program will continuously display the voltage (average of 10 samples)
	that is present on the A/D channels.

	!!!This program must be compiled to Flash.
	
	Instructions:
	-------------
	1. Connect a voltmeter to the output of the power supply that your
	going to be using.

	2. Preset the voltage on the power supply to be within the voltage
	range of the A/D converter channel that your going to test. For the
	BL2100 A/D Channels 0 - 10, input voltage range is	-10 to +10V or
	0 to 10V	depending on your controller.

	3. Power-on the controller.
	
	4. Connect the output of power supply to one of the A/D channels.

	5. Compile and run this program.

	6. Vary the voltage on a A/D channel, the voltage displayed in the STDIO
	window and voltmeter should track each other.

==================================================================================
	Here's additional information on the AD driver:
	----------------------------------------------- 
	For faster conversion times (approx. 100us) use the low level function
	anaInDriver(). See sample program AD3.C for channel to channel conversions
	or use this sample program (AD4.C) which is setup to do multiple samples
	on a given channel. 
		
	The trick to obtaining the faster conversion speeds is to either do the
	channel to channel conversions continually or by sampling a given channel
	multiple times (min. of 10 times), by doing this you're basically NULL'ing
	out the one throw away cycle that the ADC chip requires to sync-up to your
	conversion request. 

	This is why anaIn takes approx. 200us, as it has to do the throw away cycle
	and do the cycle that actually gets your data!
