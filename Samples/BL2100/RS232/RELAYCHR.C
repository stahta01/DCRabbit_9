	  	This sample program is for the BL2100 series controllers.

     	This program echoes characters to/from a serial utility such as
    	hyperterminal. The connection is as follows:

  	 	Hyperterminal Setup
  	 	-------------------
  	 	1. Set serial parameters to 19200, n, 8, 1 and no handshaking.
  	 	2. Disable "Echo characters typed locally" option. (The
  	 	   controller will echo back characters that are typed)
  	 	3. Enable send line end with line feeds.
  	 	4. Enable append line feeds to incoming lines.         

  	  	PC to controller connections
	  	----------------------------
	 	1. Connect PC Tx to serial PortB labeled RXB located on J4.
	  	2. Connect PC Rx to serial PortC labeled TXC located on J4.
	  	3. Connect PC GND to the controller's GND located on J4.

	 	Controller serial port B and port C connection
		-----------------------------------------------
 		Connect serial portB labeled TXB to port C labeled RXC located
 		on J4. 

  	   Test Instructions:
  	   ------------------
     	1. Run this program.
     	2. Run Hyperterminal.
   	3. Type characters into the serial utility window.
   	4. When done, hit the ESCAPE key on the host computer.

     	Note: This program will echo characters sent from the serial utility back to 
     	the serial utility where they will appear in its send/receive window.
