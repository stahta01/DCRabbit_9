	EXTINT_200O.C

	This program demonstrates how to use external interrupt lines to
   trigger an interrupt	service routine (ISR) in your code for the
   Rabbit 2000 CPU.  Due to a bug in the Rabbit 2000 interrupt
   handling (see technical note TN301 on the	Rabbit Semiconductor
   web page for more information), both external interrupts are
   used on the Rabbit 2000 CPU to ensure that no interrupts are
   missed.


   Instructions:
   -------------
   1. Verify there is a 1k resistor between interrupt lines PE4 and
   PE5 per technical note TN301. Also verify that the interrupt line
   isn't floating if they are then you will need to terminate the
   interrupt line with a pull-up or pull-down resistor ( >10k ).

   2. To demonstrate the interrupt, drive the interrupt line with
   a signal source to generate pulses to be counted by the interrupt
   routine for display. The program is setup to count 20 pulses and
   then will exit.

	Notes:
   -----
   1. Signal source can be as simple as a jumper wire connected to GND.
   2. The "interrupt" keyword is used to create an ISR in C code.
