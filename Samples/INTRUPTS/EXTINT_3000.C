	Samples\Intrupts\EXTINT_300O.C

	This program demonstrates how to use the external interrupt lines to
   trigger an interrupt service routine (ISR) in your code for the Rabbit
   3000 CPU.  Unlike the Rabbit 2000 CPU, both external interrupts are
   available for use on the Rabbit 3000.

   Instructions:
   -------------
   1. Verify that interrupt lines PE0 & PE1 are NOT floating, if they are
   then you will need to terminate the interrupt lines with a pull-up or
   pull-down resistor ( >10k ).

   2. To demonstrate the interrupt(s), drive the interrupt line(s) with
   a signal source to generate pulses to be counted by the interrupt
   routine for display. The program will count a minimum of 20 pulses
   on each interrupt line before exiting.

	Notes:
   -----
   1. Signal source can be as simple as a jumper wire connected to GND.
   2. The "interrupt" keyword is used to create an ISR in C code.
