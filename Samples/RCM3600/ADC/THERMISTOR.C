/********************************************************************
	thermistor.c

	This sample program is for RCM3600 series controllers with
	prototyping boards.

	Description
	===========
	This program demonstrates using analog input AIN7 to calculate
	temperature for display to STDIO window.

	This example assumes that thermistor you are using is the one
	included in the toolkit.  Values for beta, series resistor and
	resistance at standard temperature are given per part
	specification.

	Given:
	Beta = 3965
	Series resistor on protoboard = 1k ohm
	Resistance at 25 degree C = 3k ohm


	Instructions
	============
	1. Install thermistor lead into AIN7 and the other leadside
		into AGND on the prototyping board.
	2. Compile and run this program.
	3. Apply heat and cold air to the thermistor to observe
		change in temperature in the stdio window.
