	This sample program is for the RCM3600 series controllers with
	prototyping boards.


	Description
	===========
	This program demonstrates how to recalibrate an ADC milli-Amp channel using
	two known currents to generate two coefficients, gain and offset,
	which will be rewritten into to. It will also continuously display
	the current that is being monitored.

	This program must be compiled to Flash.

	Connections
	===========
	Make sure pins 3-5 are connected on JP5, JP6, and JP7.  Connect pins 1-2,
	3-4, 5-6, 7-8 on JP8.

	----------------|									|---------------------------
						 |	(optional)					| 4-20ma board
	Power supply	 |  100 ohm	 |-------|		|
	0 - 5V		  + |-/\/\/\----|current|-----| AIN channels 3 - 6
	                |	1/4 watt  | meter |		|
	                |				 ---------		|
	              - |-------------------------| AGND

	----------------|									|---------------------------

	Instructions
	============
	1. Connect a power supply of 0 - 5 volts 	to one of the AIN channel
		3 - 6 on the controller
	2. Compile and run this program.
	3. Follow the prompted directions of this program during execution.
	4. Vary voltage (0-5v) on power supply to see the CURRENT meter track
		what is displayed by Dynamic C (4-20ma).

	Note: For best results use a 4 1/2 digit current meter
