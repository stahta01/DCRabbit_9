	This sample program is for the RCM3600 series controllers with
	prototyping boards.

	Description
	===========
	This program demonstrates how to recalibrate one differential ADC channel
	using two known voltages to generate constants for that channel and
	rewritten into user block data area.  It will also continuously
	display the voltages being monitored.

	This program must be compiled to Flash.


	Power Supply to Proto-Board Connections
	=======================================
		+V			Gnd
		-----		-----
		AIN0 		AIN1
		AIN2 		AIN3
		AIN4 		AIN5

	Make sure pins 1-3 are connected on JP5, JP6, and JP7.  JP8 should
	not have any pins connected.

	Instructions
	============
	1. Connect 0-20 volt power supply positive terminal to AIN1 on the
		proto-board.
	2.	Connect power supply ground to AIN0 on the proto-board.
	3. Adjust power supply on to approximately 19.0 volts. The controller
		will see -19.0 volts across the two terminals.
	4. Compile and run this program.
	5. Enter 0 when prompted for gain code.
	6. Enter 0 when prompted for the input channel code.
	7. When prompted, switch power supply Gnd to AIN1 and positive terminal
		AIN0.
