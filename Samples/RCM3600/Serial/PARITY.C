/*******************************************************************
	parity.c

	This program is used with RCM3600 series controllers
	with prototyping boards.

	Description
	===========
	This program demonstrates use of parity modes by repeatedly
	sending byte values 0-127 from serial port D to serial port C.
	The program will switch between generating parity or not on
	port D. Port C will always be checking parity, so parity
	errors should occur during every other sequence.

	Prototyping Board Connections
	=============================

		On the RS232 connector
		-----------------------------

		(PC0) TXD <-------> RXC (PC3)


	Instructions
	============
	1.  Run this program and observe error sequence in STDIO.
