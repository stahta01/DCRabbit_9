/*****************************************************

     Samples\Low_Power.c

	Please Note:
	This program will lose communication with Dynamic C once it begins
	running. Dynamic C will display a target communication error message.
	Dynamic C cannot continue debugging once the target starts running
	off the 32 kHz oscillator. To prevent this, run with no polling (Alt-F9).

	This sample program shows how to implement a function in RAM in order
	to reduce power consumption by the Rabbit microprocessor.  There are
	four features which create the lowest possible power drain by the
	processor:
	1) Run the CPU from the 32 KHz crystal
	2) Turn off the high frequency crystal oscillator
	3) Run from RAM
	4) Insure that internal I/O instructions do not use CS0

	This sample will show LEDs toggling on the JackRabbit (BL1800) and
	CoreModule prototyping boards. If you are don't have LEDs hooked to
	PA0-PA3, you can use a scope. PA0 will blink the fastest.  After
	switching to low-power, all the LEDs blink together.
