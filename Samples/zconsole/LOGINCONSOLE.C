/********************************************************************
   loginconsole.c

	This program can be used for boards that have a second flash.
	Don't forget to make space in "RabbitBIOS.c"
		#define XMEM_RESERVE_SIZE  0x6000L  //  Amount of space in the first flash ..

	This sample program is similar to the BASICCONSOLE.C sample
	program, but it adds the commands to handling logging in.

	After setting the "LOGIN NAME" and "LOGIN PASSWORD" type
	"logout" or restart the controller.  You will then be prompted
	for a name and password.

	version 1.0 :	Initial coding.
	version 1.1 :	Added  #class auto
