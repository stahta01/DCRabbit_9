        Samples\FILESYSTEM\FAT_CREATE.C

        Demonstrate the FAT filesystem.  FAT is a filesystem familiar to
        most PC users who use the DOS operating system (i.e. Microsoft (R)
        MSDOS, IBM (R) PCDOS and similar).

        Requires the FAT filesystem module to be installed.

        Also requires that you run this on a board with a nand flash or a
        serial flash i.e. an RCM3300, RCM3700 or similar.

        This sample creates a file, writes "Hello world!" to it,
        and closes the file.

        The file is then re-opened, read, and the results printed
        to the debugging console.

        We use the default structures provided in FAT_CONFIG.LIB, so we
        don't need to define our own structures in order for FAT to work.
        (FAT_CONFIG.LIB is automatically #used by FAT.LIB.)
