 FS2DEMO3.C Filesystem Mk II sample program.

 Extends FS2DEMO2.C to use battery-backed RAM as a secondary storage
 device.

 !!! NOTE !!! -----------------------------------------------------------
 Before you can run this program, you will need to define a suitable
 value for the FS2_RAM_RESERVE near the top of .\lib\bioslib\memconfig.lib.
 This is necessary in order that the BIOS can reserve RAM for the
 filesystem.  A value of about 4k should be sufficient i.e.
   #define FS2_RAM_RESERVE 1  // Number of 4096-byte blocks
 After running this program, remember to set the value back to zero
 so that memory is not wasted.
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 You can run this demo even if you do not actually have a backup battery
 installed, so long as you do not interrupt power to the target board.

 Battery-backed SRAM (called NVRAM below) is a useful resource since it is
 much faster than flash or EEPROM memory, and does not suffer from limited
 erase cycles.  However, since it is usually a scarce resource, it would not
 normally be used to store the majority of data.  The flash filesystem can
 make use of a relatively small amount of NVRAM to hold the file metadata.

 This has the following advantages:
  . Data modification (append, overwrite, shift) is faster: up to two
    times improvement.  This is especially advantageous with sector-
    writable flash.
  . Large sector byte-writable flash can be better utilized if the
    metadata is separated.
  . Lower overall wear (erase cycles), especially for sector-writable
    flash.

 The size of the required amount of NVRAM can be calculated quite
 easily:
   Let F = the maximum number of files whose metadata is to be stored
           in NVRAM.
   Let L = the logical sector size of the NVRAM.
 Then the amount of space (S) required is:
   S = (F+1) * L

 This assumes that no file _data_ is being stored in the NVRAM.
 The logical sector size for the NVRAM can be any power of 2 between
 64 and 8192, however the larger sizes would be wasteful.  It is
 recommended that a size of either 128 or 256 be used, with 128 being
 better for most applications.

 If space is available, then NVRAM is useful for holding highly
 dynamic files which either change so frequently that normal flash
 memory would exceed its guaranteed erase cycle limit within the
 expected product lifetime, or require higher throughput rates than
 can be provided with flash.  (Most byte-writable flash devices take
 about 10-20us per byte, with several ms required for a sector erase).

 This demo program benchmarks the performance achieved by files with
 metadata only in NVRAM, as well as a 'config' file stored entirely
 in NVRAM.

 Change the initial #define's as desired.
