/*************************************************************************
 FS2DEMO4.C Filesystem Mk II sample program.

 The purpose of this program is to show a dirty trick for working out
 the amount of stack used by a program.  Specifically, the filesystem
 uses the most amount of stack when initializing.  We want to see just
 how much it uses.

 When using FS2.LIB, the stack is set to 2048 bytes by default.

 It is important to know how much stack is used, since filesystem
 initialization consumes stack as a function of the maximum number of
 logical sectors in any extent.  Doubling the number of LSs uses
 approximately 100 more bytes of stack.  For 1024 LSs, about 1K of
 stack will be needed by fs_init().  Since this is the same as the
 default stack allocation, it is best to limit the number of LSs in
 any extent ("partition") to 512.  In the case of 512 LS, fs_init()
 will take approximately 2 seconds to run.

 Change the initial #define's as desired.
