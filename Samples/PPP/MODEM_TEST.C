/*****
Tests PPP interface, with modem attached to serial port C (default).
Connects to ISP and sends a test mail.
Brings the PPP interface up and down three times.

You will nedd to change the default addresses and the mail_to[]
and mail_from[] globals.
You will also may need to alter the send/expect sequence at the
beginning of the program (plus DIALUP_NAME, DIALUP_PASSWORD and DIALUP_NUMBER).

This sample assumes you are using hardware modem flow control i.e. CTS and RTS.
The CTS port and bit number are defined in the IFS_PPP_CTSPIN parameter,
defaulting to parallel port B, bit 0.  Likewise, RTS is set via IFS_PPP_RTSPIN,
and defaults to parallel port B, bit 7.

// Following macro sets up the initial login screen navigation.  This is necessary for access to
// many ISPs, since when you dial in with the modem, the ISP does user authentication via an
// old-fashioned login screen.
// %0 gets userid substituted, %1 is password -- obtained from values passed for IFS_PPP_REMOTEAUTH.
// The string below gets compiled to "ATDT5551212 #CONNECT '' #ogin: %0 #word: %1 ~"
// This is a send/expect sequence used to establish a modem connection to the ISP (ready for PPP to
// take over).  Expanded out:
//  ATZ            - send the modem reset command (usually default config 0).  This helps get the modem
//                   into a known initial state.
//  #ok            - wait for 'ok' string (the leasing '#' means case-insensitive i.e. will accept
//                   'OK', 'Ok' etc.
//  ATDT5551212    - send the dialout command
//  #CONNECT       - wait for 'connect' message
//  ''             - Send nothing (quotes are a place-holder).  Note that the CRLF is appended to any
//                   send-string _except_ an empty string like this (but you can suppress the CRLF by
//                   prefixing the send-string with '#').
//  #ogin:         - Wait for a 'login:' message.  We don't actually look for the initial 'L' since the
//                   first character can sometimes be lost.
//  @%0            - send the userid (i.e. the value supplied by the IFS_PPP_REMOTEAUTH parameter.
//                   If the character-based login prompt expects a different userid than the one passed
//                   to the following PPP authentication phase, then you can't use %0.  In this case,
//                   put the character-based login ID directly in the send/expect string.
//                   The initial '@' character causes us to pause for 1.5 seconds before sending the
//                   string.  This is not theoretically required, however some ISPs have software which
//                   tries to discourage machine-based hacking attempts.  If we respond too quickly, the
//                   ISP thinks we are typing at inhumanly fast rates, and deems us to be a hacker.
//  #word:         - Wait for the 'password' prompt.
//  @%1            - Send the password string.  See considerations above for the logon ID string.
//  ~              - Wait for ascii tilde char (0x7E).  This is handy, since this is the first character sent
//                   by PPP when it starts up on the peer.  Some peers send an ascii 'PPP' string, but this
//                   is not quite so reliable as a means of detecting PPP startup.
