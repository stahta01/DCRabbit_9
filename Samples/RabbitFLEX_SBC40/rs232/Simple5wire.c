	Simple5wire.c

 	This program is used with RabbitFLEX SBC40 boards.

	Description
	===========
	This program demonstrates basic initialization for a
	simple RS232 5-wire loopback displayed in STDIO window.

	Here's the typical connections for a 5 wire interface that
   would be made between controllers.

		 TX <---> RX
       RX <---> TX
		RTS <---> CTS
      CTS <---> RTS
		Gnd <---> Gnd


	Connections
	===========
   1. Connect TXF and RXF together (J6 pins 2 and 4).
   2. Connect TXD/E and RXD/E together (J6 pins 1 and 3).

   Instructions
	============
	1.  Compile and run this program.
	2.  TXD and RXD (or TXE and RXE, depending on which serial port
	    is present) become the flow control RTS and CTS.
	3.  To test flow control, disconnect J6 pins 1 and 3,
       which will cause the characters to stop printing in STDIO
       window and will continue when you reconnect the pins.
