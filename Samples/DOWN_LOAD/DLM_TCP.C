	SAMPLES\DOWN_LOAD\dlm_tcp.c

	THIS PROGRAM IS PROVIDED AS A SAMPLE ONLY!

	It is intended for use ONLY with Rabbit-based boards with one or two
	flash chips in conjunction with the sample program dlp_tcp.c.  This
	version uses TCP FTP to upload the new application image.  It has been
	tested using Ethernet, but not with serial PPP.

	TO DO :
			(1) Store password into flash so it can be updated.

		*			*			*			*			*			*			*

	IMPORTANT:  Ensure that the FTP program's binary image transfer mode
		is enabled when sending the DLP to the DLM!

	IMPORTANT:  System ID Block must be version 2 or greater.

	IMPORTANT:  Test your DLP first as an ordinary program.  If that works,
		then test the DLM hooked up with the programming cable so you can
		see any error messages.  If both those work, you're ready to deploy!

		*			*			*			*			*			*			*

	TWO 256K FLASH MEMORIES OVERVIEW:
	=================================

	The download manager (DLM) is loaded as the primary program in the
	first flash memory of the Rabbit, so it becomes active after reset.
	The downloaded program (DLP) is stored as the secondary program in the
	second flash, so it becomes inactive after reset.

	The DLM uses the first 256K flash and (by default) the first half of
	SRAM.  TCP uses SRAM (xmemory) for its buffers.  This program does not
	use the File System.  Both DLM and DLP have full root memory; it's just
	the amount of xcode and (by default) xdata that is half of normal for
	the board.

	When the DLM is running, the ID/User Blocks are accessible in the MB0CR
	quadrant.  The downloaded program (DLP) is stored in the second 256K
	flash.  To start the DLP, the DLM remaps the second flash into the
	MB0CR quadrant and then executes the DLP beginning at address 0.

	To compile the 2 * 256K flash version of the DLM, ensure that the
	Project Options' Defines box contains the following macros:

	COMPILE_PRIMARY_PROG ; DONT_SPLIT_RAM

	Note that the DONT_SPLIT_RAM macro should be omitted if the DLM and DLP
	have SRAM variables that must be preserved from each other.

	Also ensure that the Project Options' Defines box does not contain any
	of these macros:

	COMPILE_SECONDARY_PROG ; ROUTE_A18_TO_FLASH_A17 ; USE_2NDFLASH_CODE


	ONE 512K FLASH MEMORY OVERVIEW:
	===============================

	The download manager (DLM) is loaded as the primary program in the
	flash memory of the Rabbit, so it becomes active after reset.  The
	downloaded program (DLP) is stored as the secondary program, so it
	becomes inactive after reset.

	The DLM uses the first 256K of flash and (by default) the first half of
	SRAM.  TCP uses SRAM (xmemory) for its buffers.  This program does not
	use the File System.  Both DLM and DLP have full root memory; it's just
	the amount of xcode and (by default) xdata that is half of normal for
	the board.

	When the DLM is running, the ID/User Blocks are accessible in the MB1CR
	quadrant.  The downloaded program (DLP) is stored in the second 256K of
	flash, less the amount of flash memory that is reserved for the ID/User
	Blocks.  To start the DLP, the DLM remaps the second half of flash into
	the MB0CR quadrant and then executes the DLP beginning at address 0.

	To compile the 1 * 512K flash version of the DLM, ensure that the
	Project Options' Defines box contains the following macros:

	COMPILE_PRIMARY_PROG ; DONT_SPLIT_RAM

	Note that the DONT_SPLIT_RAM macro should be omitted if the DLM and DLP
	have SRAM variables that must be preserved from each other.

	Also ensure that the Project Options' Defines box does not contain any
	of these macros:

	COMPILE_SECONDARY_PROG ; ROUTE_A18_TO_FLASH_A17 ; USE_2NDFLASH_CODE


	ONE 256K FLASH MEMORY OVERVIEW:
	===============================

	WARNING #1:  The TCP DLM and DLP are large progams once compiled.  With
		a single split 256K flash, most of it is taken up by the TCP stack,
		FTP and Telnet.  This leaves very little room for an application.
		Customers should consider using either two 256K flashes or one 512K
		flash in their solution.

	WARNING #2:  Since the TCP DLP is a tight fit into only 128K of flash
		(when splitting a 256K flash), the amount of memory given to the
		ID/User Blocks must be reduced.  Because the BIOS searches for ID
		Blocks on 8K boundaries, the ID/User Blocks must be version 2, which
		is a non-mirrored type.  Because version 2 ID blocks don't have a
		backup image in flash, they are not as robust as mirrored versions.
		If sudden power outages are possible, avoid version 2 user blocks.
		Customers should consider using either two 256K flashes or one 512K
		flash in their solution.

	WARNING #3:  The single split 256K flash versions of the DLM and DLP
		require a board-level hardware modification.  The Rabbit CPU's A18
		output must be re-routed to connect to the flash's A17 input.  Many
		Z-World boards have jumper pads with zero ohm resistors installed
		for this purpose.

	The download manager (DLM) is loaded as the primary program in the
	flash memory of the Rabbit, so it becomes active after reset.  The
	downloaded program (DLP) is stored as the secondary program, so it
	becomes inactive after reset.

	The DLM uses the first 128K of flash and (by default) the first half of
	SRAM.  TCP uses SRAM (xmemory) for its buffers.  This program does not
	use the File System.  Both DLM and DLP have full root memory; it's just
	the amount of xcode and (by default) xdata that is half of normal for
	the board.

	When the DLM is running, the ID/User Blocks are accessible in the MB1CR
	quadrant.  The downloaded program (DLP) is stored in the second 128K of
	flash, less the amount of flash memory that is reserved for the ID/User
	Blocks.  To start the DLP, the DLM remaps the second half of flash into
	the MB0CR quadrant and then executes the DLP beginning at address 0.

	To compile the 1 * 256K flash version of the DLM, ensure that the
	Project Options' Defines box contains the following macros:

	COMPILE_PRIMARY_PROG ; DONT_SPLIT_RAM ; ROUTE_A18_TO_FLASH_A17

	Note that the DONT_SPLIT_RAM macro should be omitted if the DLM and DLP
	have SRAM variables that must be preserved from each other.

	Also ensure that the Project Options' Defines box does not contain any
	of these macros:

	COMPILE_SECONDARY_PROG ; USE_2NDFLASH_CODE

		*			*			*			*			*			*			*

	PROJECT OPTIONS' DEFINES BOX MACRO EXPLANATIONS:
	================================================

	COMPILE_PRIMARY_PROG selects, via conditional compilation, the code
	necessary for a DLM (primary) program to run, especially regarding
	memory mapping and ID/User Blocks access.

	COMPILE_SECONDARY_PROG selects, via conditional compilation, the code
	necessary for a DLP (secondary) program to run, especially regarding
	memory mapping and ID/User Blocks access.

	DONT_SPLIT_RAM disables the default setting, via conditional macro
	redefinitions, of the division of SRAM between the DLM (lower half) and
	the DLP (upper half).  When this macro is defined, the DLM and the DLP
	will trample each others' SRAM variables, but this doesn't matter if
	neither has vital data that must be preserved in SRAM.

	Note:  INVERT_A18_ON_PRIMARY_FLASH is obsolete, and no longer has
	effect even if it is defined.

	ROUTE_A18_TO_FLASH_A17 selects, via conditional compilation, the code
	necessary to set up the unusual memory mapping and ID/User Blocks
	access that is required required when the single split-256K flash
	hardware modification is done.

	USE_2NDFLASH_CODE  is not related to putting a secondary program in the
	second flash, and MUST be commented out when compiling this program.

		*			*			*			*			*			*			*

	SINGLE 256K FLASH NOTES:
	========================

	The single split 256K flash version requires a hardware board
	modification.  The Rabbit CPU's A18 output must be re-routed to the
	flash chip's A17 input.  On many Z-World boards, there are zero ohm
	resistors (jumpers) to accomplish this.  Add ROUTE_A18_TO_FLASH_A17 in
	the Project Options' Defines box for both the DLM and the DLP.  If
	neither the DLM nor the DLP have SRAM variables that must be protected
	from the other, then also define DONT_SPLIT_RAM there.

	If you get the compiler error message:

		Out of xmem code space, use a larger ROM/RAM.
	..or..
		Origin xmemcode collides with origin watcode starting at physical address 0xfdc00.

	you may need to decrease the total size of the ID/User Blocks to free
	up flash space for more XMEM code.

	IMPORTANT:  Carefully consider the (negative) effects of altering the
	ID/User Blocks, particularly if your board has stored factory
	calibration constants.  Do not alter the ID/User Blocks if you are
	unsure that it is OK to do so!

	Use the write_idblock.c utility (available in the TN224.ZIP file from
	Z-World's web site) to write an 8K version 2 ID Block.  Change the
	constants in write_idblock.c from 0x4000 to 0x2000 (16K to 8K), and
	force a version 2 ID Block.  (If you've performed the single split 256K
	flash hardware modification, compile and run write_idblock.c as a
	split-256K flash DLM program to avoid undoing and re-doing the hardware
	modification.)  Then, in .\lib\bioslib\StdBIOS.c, define
   MAX_USERBLOCK_SIZE to be 0x2000 and recompile the BIOS and then the DLM.
   (The BIOS's	MAX_USERBLOCK_SIZE macro reserves that amount of space for
   the ID/User	Blocks.)

		*			*			*			*			*			*			*

	COMPILING THE DOWNLOADED PROGRAMS:
	==================================

	Before compiling the DLM to the target, first compile the DLP to a BIN
	file.  Z-World provides dlp_tcp.c, dlp_serial_2_flash.c and
	dlp_256kflash.c as sample downloaded application programs.  Follow the
	instructions in the appropriate downloaded program source to compile a
	DLP that is suitable for your purpose and compatible with the target
	Rabbit board.

	After you've compiled the DLP to a BIN file, if necessary, transfer it
	to a computer with an FTP client.  (If you do this often, make a little
	batch file that copies the file somewhere, renaming it to "image.bin"
	along the way.)

	The dlm_tcp.c DLM's download image is a binary file.  While the serial DLM
	requires an Intel Hex dump file, the TCP DLM's FTP server reads the binary
	file directly.

		*			*			*			*			*			*			*

	COMMON MODIFIABLE CONSTANTS:
	============================

	Here are some constants you might want to check out and modify.

	TCP/IP Things:
	--------------
	* MY_IP_ADDRESS, MY_NETMASK, MY_NETMASK, MY_NETMASK
		Typically identify and network navigation values.  If you're using
		DHCP, these values become fallbacks.
	* FTP_CMDPORT
		Overrides default port of 21 for FTP.  Same as USE_TCP_PORT in DLP.
	* USE_DHCP, DHCP_CHECK
		Have the DLM query for its IP address.

	Timeouts:
	---------
	* IDLE_TIMEOUT_SECS
		How long the DLM waits before rebooting.  If an FTP connection does
		something of significance then the timeout time restarts.  Set high
		for DLM_debugging, and low (maybe 14) while in the field.

	User Identification/Authentication:
	-----------------------------------
	* USER_NAME, USER_PASSWORD
		Identification used by FTP server to determine a valid user.

		*			*			*			*			*			*			*

	COMPILING THE DOWNLOAD MANAGER:
	===============================

	Connect the programming cable to the Rabbit target board.  Ensure that
	the Project Options' Defines box contains the appropriate macros for
	the particular 2* 256K, 1 * 512K, or 1 * 256K flash equipped Rabbit
	board, as listed above in the MEMORY OVERVIEWs.

	You can change the username and/or password.  To use the standard FTP
	port, comment out the line:
					#define FTP_CMDPORT  9011

	The DLM can also use DHCP.  Below, uncomment USE_DHCP and DHCP_CHECK.
	When the DLM boots up it will then ask for its IP address.  Configure
	your DHCP server to provide leases that never expire, otherwise you
	might not be able to reach your board again!

	Compile the dlm_tcp.c program to the target, then disconnect the
	programming cable and reboot the board.  The download manager will now
	be running and listening on the (non-standard) FTP port.  (The above
	steps need only be done once; thereafter the DLM runs after a hardware
	reset or power cycle.)


	DOWNLOAD MANAGER OPERATION:
	===========================

	When the DLM boots up, it listens on an FTP port.  Only the user-
	password combination defined by USER_NAME and USER_PASSWORD (see defines
	below) is valid.  Security by obfuscation is to use a non-standard
	FTP port.  In this case port #9011 is used.  To connect with a command
	line system, try this:

				C:> ftp
				ftp> open targetsys 9011
				Connected to targetsys.factory.com.
				220 Hello! Welcome to ZWorld TinyFTP!
				Name (unknown):

	Normally FTP is invoked with a target host name.  However, if you don't
	specify a host, FTP goes into interactive mode.  The "open" command
	connects to a remote host uses a specific port number.  Normal login
	occurs at this point (tested under Microsoft NT 4.0 and Linux 2.2).
	If you use the standard FTP port, then invoking "ftp targetsys" is OK.

	Once authenticated, the FTP client will find these files:
		* "image.bin"  --  Place to upload the application image (.BIN file).
								The size is neveer correct (ignore it).
		* "reboot.me"  --  Reading here gives lastest upload image size and
								CRC values.  Writing causes DLM to boot into the
								application
		* "SysIDBlock.bin"  --  Reveals the system ID block as a read-only
								file.
		* "status" -- Results of last download attempt.

	(These names can be #define'd to different strings.)

	When transfering files, be sure you're in BINARY mode.  Most FTP clients
	default to ASCII mode, which translates newline character.  After logging
	in, the user should issue "bin" (for binary mode transfers) followed by
	"put image.bin".  You'll need a small file named "reboot.me" to upload
	and boot the user application.  One way is to "get reboot.me" followed
	by "put reboot.me".  The DLM will then close all FTP connections (you'll
	see "421 Service not avaialble, remote server has closed connection")
	and turn off the Ethernet chip.

	Note, the user application is uploaded directly to flash.  If the network
	upload is interrupted midway, then part of the flash will be updated.
	The other half will be the previous contents.  This is bad.  Restart the
	DLM and upload again.

	After the FTP server is shut down, the DLM calls tcp_tick() for two
	more seconds before turing off the Ethernet controller (pd_shutdown()
	added in 7.20).  Booting into the user application requires remapping
	the flash chips.  You can't be executing code in flash when this
	happens.  So, a small assem routine is copied into a RAM `char'
	buffer (Chip_SW_Func[]) to manipulate the MBnCR registers (Memory Bank
	#n Control Reg).

		*			*			*			*			*			*			*

	REBOOTING THE USER APPLICATION:
	===============================

	The source file dlp_tcp.c contains code to listen on a TCP port for a
	reboot command.  If some user can prove they know the password, or get
	the right answer to the puzzle, it will remap the flash and boot into
	the DLM.

	The DLP image is a binary file, which the FTP server reads directly.
	Note that if you upload the new application in ASCII mode, newline
	translation is done.  Thus, the CRC will be correct but the loaded
	image is wrong.  Then, when the DLM tries to run the DLP the Rabbit may
	hang.  In this case, you'll need to *manually reset* the board to
	regain control.  If you want better control, try the DeviceMate product
	from Z-World.

	USE OF FTP_SERVER.LIB:
	======================

	This application uses the FTP server library to provide a well-known
	transfer protocol.  By default, the FTP server library handles read-only
	files.  To allow writing to flash and rebooting the DLM, the operations
	of writing to FTP files is extended by functions in this application.
	The functions are named my_ftp_open(), my_ftp_write() and my_ftp_close().
	Because they replace pieces of the library, the are given specific
	parameters.  Some parameters are unused if they're aren't applicable
	to the specific usage, e.g. directories.

	EXTENSIONS:
	===========

	If the target Rabbit board has 512K SRAM, DONT_SPLIT_RAM is not defined
	in the Project Options' Defines box, and you want more SRAM memory for
	the DLP, you could reuse some from the DLM.  The idea is to have the
	DLM xalloc() some of its unused xmemory, and then leave a pointer in
	the User Block.  When the user application runs, it reads out the
	xmemory pointer.  However, the address is to SRAM that was in MB2CR
	quadrant, but now has been mapped to MB3CR quadrant!  Therefore, the
	DLP must subtract 0x40000uL from the xmemory pointer before using it.


	NOTES:
	======

	The function ProcessProgramByte() assumes that the sector size of the
	second flash is the same as the sector size of the primary flash.
	This may not always be the case, but it should still work if it is
	not.  Flash writing speed would be decreased if the primary flash has
	a smaller sector size.

	This program just barely fits into 128K of code (half of a 256K flash
	memory chip).  To achieve this, make a few adjustments.  In the Project
	Options' Compiler tab, turn off all runtime checking and optimize for
	size, not speed.

Description:
	This function processes bytes received from the DLM hex file
	processing state machine and writes them to the 2nd flash. It
	waits until a full sector has been received before writing to
	the flash. Before it writes to the flash, it tells the host
	to pause transmission so data is not lost.

Assumption:
	The program will be received in one contiguous block starting on a
	sector boundary.

Input:
	ch - the byte to be processed

Return value:
	0 == everthing good so far.
	!0 == a write to flash fails in which case the return value of the
			failed call to zapWriteFlash() is returned.
