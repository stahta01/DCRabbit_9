/******************************************************************************
	timer_b2.c

	This example program produces a precicely-timed pulse of duration 34.7
	microseconds (rollover/4) on port E, bit 7 every 138.88 microseconds
 	(timer B rollover) with a 14MHz CPU clock -- other boards will
 	produce different times depending on the CPU frequency.  The port E bit is
 	updated when the match occurs, not when the ISR is called, which produces
 	the precise timing.  The ISR uses the lowest bit of the count variable
 	to determine whether to turn the pulse on or off.

	Note that if the ISR call is delayed (typically due to another interrupt
	handler such as the serial ISR), two timer B matches will go by before
	the ISR is called (try running this demo with and without polling).
	This will produce an incorrect-width pulse, however the ISR below will
	realign the match and pulse values in the next cycle.

	NOTE: if your board is using parallel port E for another purpose (for
	example, the OP6800), then running this sample may cause unusual results
	(odd behavior, program crash, etc.).
