	timer_b.c

	This example program produces a pulse on port A every time timer B is
	zero (the ISR reloads match register B1 with zero each time it is
	called).  This produces a pulse train with a frequency of 7200 Hz with
	a 14MHz CPU clock.  Since the pulse is produced when the ISR is called,
	the timing between pulses is NOT precise!

 ******************************************************************************

	Timer B is a 10-bit counter that can be clocked with perclk/2, perclk/16,
	or with the output of timer A1.  perclk is the peripheral clock, which
	is usually set to the main oscillator frequency (but may be set to that
	frequency divided by eight if the CPU is also using that clock/8).

	For a 14MHz CPU clock, the timer B rollover times are as follows
	(timer A1 defaults to being clocked with perclk/2):

		Timer B Input	Timer B resol.		Rolls over every	Rollover freq.
		-------------	--------------		----------------	--------------
		  perclk/2		0.135 microsec		138.88 microsec		7200 Hz
		  perclk/16		1.085 microsec		  1.11 millisec		 900 Hz

	Keep these things in mind when using timer B:

		1.  The A/D and D/A channels on the Jackrabbit use timer B -- you
			 cannot use timer B if you plan on doing any analog/digital
			 conversion!

		2.  If you plan on using timer A1 as timer B input, be warned that
			 the serial port buad rates are based on A1 and will need to be
			 modified as well.

	Timer B contains two match registers, B1 and B2.  These can be programmed
	to produce an interrupt when timer B matches the register and/or to
	update output values on ports D and E.

	Watch out for the timer B match registers -- there are two bytes for
	each register, and the bits of the upper byte are not in the
	"expected" locations:

				   Match register MSB		Match register LSB
			  |------------------------|------------------------|
		Bit: | 9  8  x  x  x  x  x  x	| 7  6  5  4  3  2  1  0 |
			  |------------------------|------------------------|
			    ^  ^

 ******************************************************************************
	Uses:

	Because of the high rollover frequency, timer B is well-suited for
	producing a pulse (or updating an output) of precise length, or at
	a precise time in the future (but within the rollover time).  It
	is not so well-suited for producing a train of pulses at a particular
	frequency since (a) the pulse frequency must be greater than the
	rollover frequency for the match registers to work, and (b) the next
	timer B match must be recalcuated each time (but see below).

	If a simple fraction of the rollover frequency is acceptable, then
	timer B can be used.  For example, a short pulse at 7200 Hz can be
	produced by an ISR that always reloads the match register with zero, so
	that the interrupt is always produced when timer B is zero.  Similarly,
	a more complicated ISR could set the match register to zero the first time,
	512 the second time, zero the third time, 512 the fourth time, and so on
	to produce a pulse train with a frequency of 2*7200 = 14.4 kHz.

	Pulse-width modulation is another good use for timer B.  If one of the
	two rollover frequencies above is acceptable for your application, then
	a pulse can always be turned on when timer B is zero, and turned off at
	a specific match value that produces the desired duty cycle (0-100%), i.e.

							match = duty cycle * 1024

	(in reality, the time required for an ISR to load a new match register
	will prevent the very lowest and highest duty cycles from working).
