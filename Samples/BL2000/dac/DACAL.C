	Dacal.c
	
	This sample program is used with the BL20XX series controllers.

	!!!Caution this will overwrite the calibration constants set at
	   the factory.  This program must be compiled to Flash.
	
	This program demonstrates how to recalibrate an DAC channel using
	two known voltages and defines the two coefficients, gain and offset,
	which will be rewritten into the DAC's EEPROM (simulated in Flash). 

	Instructions:
	1.Connect a voltage meter to an output channel.
	2.Compile and run this program.
	3.Follow the prompted directions of this program during execution.
