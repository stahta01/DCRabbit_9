/**************************************************************************

     Samples\BL2000\RS232\Puts.c

	  This sample program is for the BL20XX series controllers.

	  This program transmits and then receives an ASCII string on serial 
	  ports B and C. It also displays the serial data received from both
	  ports in Dynamic C STDIO window.
	
     Add a wire jumper between the following points on the controller:
     	 On connector J1 connect RS232 TXD1 to RXD2 
       On connector J1 connect RS232 TXD2 to RXD1	
       
     Run this program.
