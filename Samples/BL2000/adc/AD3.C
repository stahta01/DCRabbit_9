/***************************************************************************
	Samples\BL2000\ADC\ad3.c

	This sample program is used the BL20XX series controllers.

	This program demonstrates how to access the A/D channels with the low 
	level A/D driver. The program will continuously display the voltage
	thats being monitored on all the A/D channels with using the low level
	A/D driver.

	!!!This program must be compiled to Flash.

	Instructions:
	-------------
	1. Connect a voltmeter to the output of the power supply that
	your using.

	2. Preset the voltage on the power supply to be within the voltage
	range of the A/D converter channel that your going to test.
 		* A/D Channels 0 - 3. Input voltage range is	-10 to +10 volts.
		* A/D Channels 4 - 8. Input voltage range is	0 to +48 volts.
		* A/D Channels 9 - 10. Depends on the controller type that you have:
			- BL2000/BL2020  Sample program N/A for these two controllers.
			- BL2010/BL2030  Channels have input voltage range of 0 to + 48v.

	3. Power-on the controller.
	
	4. Connect the output of power supply to one of the A/D channels.

	5. Compile and run this program.

	6. Vary the voltage to the A/D channel, the voltage displayed in the
	STDIO window and voltmeter should track each other.
