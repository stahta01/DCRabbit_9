	Samples\BL2000\io\digIn.c

	This sample program is for the BL2000 series controllers.
	
	This program demonstrates the use of the digital inputs. With
	using the provided DEMO board in your kit you can see a input
	channel toggle from HIGH to LOW when pressing a push button on
	the DEMO board.
	
	
	Test Setup:
	-----------
	1. DEMO board jumper settings:
			- H1 remove all jumpers 
			- H2 jumper pins 3-5  
              jumper pins 4-6
              
	2. Connect a wire from the controller J1, GND to the DEMO board
	   J1, GND.
	   
	3. On the controller add a wire between J1, +RAW and +K.

	4. Connect a wire from the controller J1, +RAW to the DEMO board
	   J1, +5 volts.

	The DEMO board has been designed to withstand the full input voltage
	range of a BL2000 series controller.

	Test Instructions:
	------------------
	1. Connect SW1 - SW4 from the demo board to any four inputs on the
	   controller, choose from IN0 - IN9.
	2. Compile and run this program.
	3. Press any one of the DEMO board switches SW1 - SW4 and you should
	   see the input go LOW on the channel the switch is connected to.
	4. Move connections from the demo board to other inputs and repeat
	   steps 1 - 4.
