	Samples\BL2000\IO\digOut.c

	This sample program is for the BL2000 series controllers.
	
	This program demonstrates the use of the high current outputs. With
	using the provided DEMO board in your kit you can see a LED Toggle 
	ON/OFF via a high current output.
	
	Test Setup:
	-----------
	1. On the controller add a wire between J1, +RAW and +K.
	
	2. Add a wire from the controller J1, GND to the DEMO board J1, GND.
	
	3. Add a wire from the controller J1, +RAW to the DEMO board J1, +5V.
	   
   This is going to power the LED's on the DEMO board. And with a 3.3k
   ohm resistor in series with the LED, the LED's can withstand the full
   input voltage range for a BL2000 series controller. 
	  
	
	
	Test Instructions:
	------------------
	1. Connect LED1 - LED4 from the DEMO board to any 4 outputs on the 
	   controller, choose from OUT0 - OUT9.
	2. Compile and run this program.
	3. The program will prompt you to select the output channel that you
	   want to toggle. Select the desired channel and then the logic level
	   you want to set it to. When done you'll see the LED connected to
	   the output selected change states.  
	4. Move connections from the DEMO board to other outputs and repeat
	   steps 1 - 4.
