	Samples\BL2000\io\relay.c

	This sample program is used with BL20XX series controllers.
	
	This program demonstrates how to control the relay. You can use a
	ohmmeter to verify the connections.
	
	1. You should have low impedences between the Common contact and the
	   Normally Closed contact when in the COM_NC state. To verify, set
	   a breakpoint(using F2) on the following statement in the mainline
	   function and use the ohmmeter to verify the connection.

	   	printf("Relay_COM is connected to Relay_NC contact\n");
		   
	2. You should have low impedences between the Common contact and the 
	   Normally Open contact when in the COM_NO state. To verify, set a
	   breakpoint(using F2) on the following statement in the mainline
	   function and use the ohmmeter to verify the connection.

	   	printf("Relay_COM is connected to Relay_NO contact\n");

	Note: When turning the relay ON and OFF, LED0 will also be toggling
	      because its tied to the same control signal.
