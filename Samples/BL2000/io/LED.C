/**************************************************************************
	Samples\BL2000\io\led.c

	This sample program is used with BL20XX series controllers.
	
	This program demonstrates how to toggle the LED's on
	on the controller.
	
	Use led.c to program the controller.

	The program will toggle the following LED's:

	0 = OUT0_LED
	1 = OUT1_LED
	2 = OUT2_LED
	3 = OUT3_LED
	4 = BAD_INDICATOR

	Note: When turning LED0 ON and OFF, RELAY0 will also be toggling because
	      its tied to the same control signal.

#class auto


#define LEDOFF 0  //Value used to turn the LED OFF
#define LEDON	1	//Value used to turn the LED ON

	auto unsigned int led; 	// variable used to cycle thru all the LED's

			//Turn-on the LED indicated by the led variable
