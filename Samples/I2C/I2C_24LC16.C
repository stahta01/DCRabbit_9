/******************************************************************
	Samples\I2C\i2c_24LC16.c

	sample I2C interface with a Microchip 24LC16 serial EEPORM.
	The I2C library defaults to using PD6 as SCL and PD7 as SDA. These
	should be connected to the EEPROM chip with pull up resistors.

	This sample will attempt to write a string to the beginning of the
	memory space and then read it back.
