/*****************************************************

	flash2demo.c

	This program demonstrates writing to the 2nd flash
	(up to 256kb in size) on products with two flash devices.

   The WriteFlash2() function from XMEM.LIB requires
	that both flash devices on the board must be the
	same type; this should not be a problem with
	existing Z-World products.

	As of Dynamic C 7.03, the second flash (if installed)
	is mapped to the second memory quadrant (physical
	addresses 0x00040000-0x0007FFFF).  This flash can
	be written to with the WriteFlash2() function and
	read from with xmem2root().
