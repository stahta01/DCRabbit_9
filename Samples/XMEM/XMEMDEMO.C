	 xmemdemo.c

    Example of using the XMEM access functions root2xmem and xmem2root.

	 This program demonstrates the use of the XMEM functions by writing a block
    of data to a physical memory location and then reading it back, first with
    all zeros and then with the entire buffer set to 0x55.
