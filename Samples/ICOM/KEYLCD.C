	keylcd.c

	Use this sample with Intellicom Series products.

	This program demonstrates a simple setup for a user-defined 2x6 keypad
	and a 4x20 display.  Keypad characters will display when keys are
	pressed.  The output wraps from bottom back to the first line.

 	Backlight and contrast are not supported on VFD's.
	For this example to work properly, the display should be connected to
	parallel	port A as described here and in the example circuitry:

		PA.0	Out	LCD Backlight (if connected)
		PA.1	Out	Display CS (Active High)
		PA.2	Out	Display RS (High = Control, Low = Data) / LCD Contrast 0
		PA.3	Out	Display WR (Active Low) / LCD Contrast 1
		PA.4	Out	Display D4 / LCD Contrast 2
		PA.5	Out	Display D5 / LCD Contrast 3
		PA.6	Out	Display D6 / LCD Contrast 4
		PA.7	Out	Display D7 / LCD Contrast 5

	The keypad should be connected to parallel ports B, C and D
	as described here and in the example circuitry:

		PB.0	In		Keypad Col 0
		PC.1	In		Keypad Col 1
		PB.2	In		Keypad Col 2
		PB.3	In		Keypad Col 3
		PB.4	In		Keypad Col 4
		PB.5	In		Keypad Col 5
		PD.6	O.C.	Keypad Row 0
		PD.7	O.C.	Keypad Row 1

	This program will configure to the following keypad layout:

	[  1  ] [  2  ] [  3  ] [  4  ] [  5  ] [  .  ]
	[  6  ] [  7  ] [  8  ] [  9  ] [  0  ] [Enter]
