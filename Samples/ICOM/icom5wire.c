/********************************************************************
	icom5wire.c

	This sample program is used with products such as
	Intellicom Series.

	You must have an RS232 device properly installed and configured
	as a 5-wire circuit.  Requires hardware modifications.

	This program demonstrates a simple serial communication
	with flow control.  Loopback is displayed in STDIO window.

	Serial port C and B on parallel port C's alternate function
	is	used. TxC and RxC become RTS and CTS.  TxB and RxB become
	Tx and Rx.

   NOTE: You must first make hardware modications, including
   	desoldering some components.
	Make the following loopback connections labeled on J7.

		 Tx (RTS) <---> Rx (CTS)		// DATA
		485+ (Tx) <---> 485- (Rx)		// FLOW CONTROL

	To test flow control, disconnect RTS from CTS while running
	this program.  Characters should stop printing in STDIO window
	and continue when RTS and CTS are connected again.
