/********************************************************************
	tcp_respond.c

 	This sample program is used with Intellicom Series.

	This program and tcp_send.c are to be executed on two different
	Intellicom boards so that the two boards communicate with each
	other.  A TCP socket is used to send a very reliable datagram.

	In the absence of a second board, pcsend.exe can be used on
	the PC console side at the command prompt.  This executable and
	source code is located in \samples\icom\windows directory.

	If you use telnet to connect (ie "telnet 10.10.6.100 4040"),
	this code will disconnect after sending each response.  Simply
	re-connect (run telnet again) to get the next response.

	This program waits for a message from another machine.  The message
	received is displayed on the LCD, and the user is allowed to respond
	by pressing a key on the keypad.  The response is then sent to the
	remote machine.
