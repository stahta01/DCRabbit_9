/********************************************************************
	Samples\RCM2300\extsram.c

	This sample program demonstrates setup and simple addressing
	to an	external sram.
	
	Use with RCM2300 series controller.  Connect circuitry as
	described in your User Manual Sample Circuit Section.

	This program first maps the external sram to I/O Bank 7 register
	with 15 wait states (max), chip select strobe (PE7), and permits
	writes.

	The first 16 bytes of sram are cleared and read back.  Values
	are the written to the same area and read back.  STDIO window
	will indicate if writes and reads did not occur.
