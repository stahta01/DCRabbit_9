/*****************************************************

     Samples\RCM2300\toggleled.c

     Demonstration using costatements with the RCM2300 and prototyping board.

     This program will flash DS2 on the RCM2300 prototyping Board once per
     second (bit 1 on port E).  This program will also watch button S3 (port B
     bit 3) and toggle LED DS3 (port E bit 7) on/off when pressed.  Note that
     the button is debounced by the software.

     Port A can be set for all outputs or all inputs via the slave port control
     register (SPCTRL).  If the slave port is being used then port A should not
     be used.

     Port B bits 0-5 are always inputs, and bits 6-7 are always outputs.  If the
     slave port is being used then port B should not be used.

     Port E bits 1,7 are always I/O, and bits 0,2-6 are left as unchanged,
     available for external I/O control.
