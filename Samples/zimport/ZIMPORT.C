      zimport.c

      Demonstration of the zimport compiler directive.

      Usage:
      #zimport "filename" symbolname

      The usage of #zimport is identical to #ximport,
      except that the imported file is compressed, and
      the top bit of the length quantity is flipped to
      signify the imported file is compressed. The
      zimport.lib library defines a macro to mask out this
      bit called ZIMPORT_MASK.

      In order to read the compressed file, the
      zimport.lib library must be used.

      Load the "filename" file length into xmem at the
      next xcodorg location.  Follow the length with
      the contents of the file.  Create a constant MACRO
      "symbolname" which contains the physical address
      where "filename" length and contents were stored.

		The LZ compression algorithm used by zimport (based
		upon the freely available LZ77 algorithm) utilizes
		a 4KB internal buffer (in RAM) for decompression, and
		a 24K buffer for compression (compression also requires
		a 4K input buffer, which is allocated automatically for
		each output buffer that is defined). The zimport
		compression library handles memory management
		internally by pre-allocating these buffers. The
		default is a single 4KB input (decompression) buffer,
		and no output (compression) buffer.

		The number of buffers to be used can be controlled
		through the use of two macros:
		OUTPUT_COMPRESSION_BUFFERS  (default = 0) and
		INPUT_COMPRESSION_BUFFERS   (default = 1)
		These numbers should coincide with the largest
		possible number of simultaneous open ZFILE's for
		output and input, respectively.

      This program uses zimport to import and compress a
      sample file and then decompresses the imported file
      to stdio.
