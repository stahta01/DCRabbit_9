1. Definitions. In addition to the definitions stated in the first paragraph of this document, capitalized words used in this License shall have the following meanings:
1.1 "Qualified Applications" means an application program developed using the Software and that links with the development libraries of the Software.  
1.1.1 "Qualified Applications" is amended to include application programs developed using the Softools WinIDE program for Rabbit processors available from Softools, Inc.  
1.1.2 The MicroC/OS-II (uC/OS-II) library and sample code released with any version of Dynamic C, and the Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) library released prior to Dynamic C version 7.32 are not included in this amendment.
1.1.3 Excluding the exceptions in 1.1.2, library and sample code provided with the Software may be modified for use with the Softools WinIDE program in Qualified Systems as defined in 1.2. All other Restrictions specified by this license agreement remain in force.
1.2 "Qualified Systems" means a microprocessor-based computer system which is either (i) manufactured by, for or under license from Z-WORLD, or (ii) based on the Rabbit 2000 microprocessor or the Rabbit 3000 microprocessor.  Qualified Systems may not be (a) designed or intended to be re-programmable by your customer using the Software, or (b) competitive with Z-WORLD products, except as otherwise stated in a written agreement between Z-World and the system manufacturer.

(iv) use and distribute with Qualified Applications and Qualified Systems the program files distributed with Dynamic C named RFU.EXE, PILOT.BIN, and COLDLOAD.BIN in their unaltered forms. 

3. Restrictions.  Except as otherwise stated, You may not, nor permit anyone else to, decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble or otherwise attempt to reconstruct or discover the source code of the Software, alter, merge, modify, translate, adapt in any way, prepare any derivative work based upon the Software, rent, lease network, loan, distribute or otherwise transfer the Software or any copy thereof.
