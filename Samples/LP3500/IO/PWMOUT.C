/********************************************************************
	pwmout.c

	This sample program is intended for the LP3500 series controllers.

	Description
	===========
	This program demonstrates the PWM functions.

	It will set the PWM channels, PWM0-PWM2, to the	following
	duty cycles:

	PWM CHAN 0 to 10%
	PWM CHAN 1 to 25%
	PWM CHAN 2 to 50%

	Instructions
	============
	1. Compile and run this program.
	2. Best way to view duty cycles is to observe each channel
	   with an oscilloscope.
