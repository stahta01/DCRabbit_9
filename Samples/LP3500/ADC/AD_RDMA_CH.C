	This sample program is used with LP3500 series controllers

	Description
	===========
	This program demonstrates how to read an ADC milli-Amp channel using
	previously defined coefficients. It will also continuously display
	the current that is being monitored.

	Instructions
	============
	1. Jumpers must be installed on J3 for each input to be read.

	2. Connect a power supply of 0-3 volts with a series 0 ohm resistor
	to one of the AIN channel 0 - 3 on the controller


	----------------|									|---------------------------
						 |									| 4-20ma board
	Power supply	 |  100 ohm	 |-------|		|
	0 - 4v		  + |-/\/\/\----|current|-----| AIN channels 0 - 3
	                |	1/4 watt  | meter |		|
	                |				 ---------		|
	              - |-------------------------| AGND
					    |									|
	----------------|									|---------------------------

	3. Compile and run this program.
	4. Follow the prompted directions of this program during execution.
	5. Vary voltage (0-4v) on power supply to see the CURRENT meter track
	what is displayed by Dynamic C (4-20ma).

	Note: For best results use a 4 1/2 digit current meter
