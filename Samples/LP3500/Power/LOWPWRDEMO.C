	This sample program is intended for LP3500 series controllers.

	Description
	===========
	This program demonstrates low power mode with normal power source.


	Instructions
	============
	1. Press F5 to compile this program.
	2. Press ALT-F9 to to run without polling. Do not remove the cable so
		messages will be displayed in STDIO window.
