	  	This sample program is for the OP7200 series controllers.

     	This program echos characters to/from a serial utility such as
    	hyperterminal. The connection is as follows:

  	 	Hyperterminal Setup
  	 	-------------------
  	 	1. Set serial parameters to 19200, n, 8, 1 and no handshaking.
  	 	2. Disable "Echo characters typed locally" option. (The
  	 	   controller will echo back characters that are typed)
  	 	3. Enable send line end with line feeds.
  	 	4. Enable append line feeds to incoming lines.         

  	  	PC to controller connections
	  	----------------------------
	 	1. Connect PC Tx to serial PortC labeled RXC located on J11.
	  	2. Connect PC Rx to serial PortD labeled TXD located on J11.
	  	3. Connect PC GND to the controller's GND located on J11.

	 	Controller serial port C and port D connection
		-----------------------------------------------
 		Connect serial portC labeled TXC to port D labeled RXD located
 		on J11. 

  	   Test Instructions:
  	   ------------------
     	1. Run this program.
     	2. Run Hyperterminal.
     	3. Type characters into the serial utility window.

     	Note: This program will echo characters sent from the serial utility
     	      back to the serial utility where they will appear in its send-
     	      receive window.
