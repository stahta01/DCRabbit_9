	digOut.c

	This sample program is for the OP7200 series controllers.
	
	This program demonstrates the use of the high-current outputs configured
	as SINKING and SOURCING type outputs. The sample program requires the use
	the DEMO board that was provided in your development kit so you can see
	the LED's toggle ON/OFF via the high-current outputs.

	Attention!!!
	------------
	The high-current output OUT0 is being used to provide power to the DEMO
	board. And outputs OUT1-OUT4 (configured as SINKING drivers) are being
	used to control the LEDS. 

	Test Setup:
	-----------
	1. DEMO board jumper settings:
			- H1 remove all jumpers 
			- H2 jumper pins 3-5  
              jumper pins 4-6             	

	2. Connect a wire from the controller J3 GND, to the DEMO board
	   J1 GND.

	   Note: Input -PWR isn't digital GND due to the bridge rectifier
            that's in the power input circuit. 
	   
	3. Connect a wire on the controller from +PWR to +K on connector J3.

	4. Connect a wire from the controller J3 OUT0, to the DEMO board
	   J1 +K.

	5. Connect the following wires from the controller connector J3 to
	   the DEMO board J1:
	   
	   	From OUT1 to LED1
	   	From OUT2 to LED2
	   	From OUT3 to LED3
	   	From OUT4 to LED4

   Note: This is going to power the LED's on the DEMO board. With the 3.3k
         ohm resistor in series with the LED, the LED's can withstand the
         full input voltage range for a OP7200 series controller. 
	  	
	Test Instructions:
	------------------
	1. Connect LED1 - LED4 from the DEMO board to any 4 outputs on the 
	   controller as in Test Setup above or choose from OUT1 - OUT7.

	2. Compile and run this program.

	3. The program will prompt you for your channel selection, select
	   Output Channel OUT0. After making the channel selection you'll
	   be prompted to select the logic level, set the channel OUT0 to
	   a logic high level to provide power to the DEMO Board.

	4. At this point your ready to start toggling the LEDS by selecting
	   selecting channels OUT1 - OUT4, and changing the logic level. 

	5. To check other outputs use a voltmeter to verify that the channels
	   have changed to the level that you have set it to.
