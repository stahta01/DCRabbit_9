/*************************************************************************
 Samples\SEEDTEST.C   Demo program to test the random seed generator.

 When this program is run, press keys randomly.  Every time sufficient
 "randomness" has been accumulated, by timing the interval between
 keystrokes, the random data is extracted and printed as a number between
 0 and 7.

 If you hold a key down (i.e. use the typematic feature of your keyboard),
 then in theory the results will not be random since the time intervals
 will be fairly uniform.  In practice, there is enough variability in
 the timings to still allow a fairly good random number stream to be
 generated.

 The number of random bits which can be accumulated depends on
 the time interval, and the resolution with which the time interval can
 be measured.

 If timer B is not used, then 4 bits can be accumulated approximately
 every second (depending on the number of independent timings which
 can be made).  If timer B is running, it can be used to increase the
 resolution of the timer clock.  With timer B running at maximum rate,
 10 bits can be accumulated every second.
