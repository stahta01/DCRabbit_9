	This sample program is for the BL2600 series controller.

	Description
	===========
	This program demonstrates how to recalibrate an ADC milli-amp channel
	using two known currents to generate two coefficients, gain and offset,
	which will be rewritten into reserved eeprom. It will also continuously
	displays the current that is being monitored.

	Instructions
	============
	1. Connect a current meter in series as shown below with it set to
   read 4 to 20 milli-amps of current.

	-----------------|									 |---------------------------
						  |									 | 4-20ma mode of operation
	Power supply	  |          + |-------| -		 |
	0 - 2.5v		 POS |------------|current|-------| AIN channels 0 - 3
	                 |	         | meter |		 |
	                 |            ---------       |
	                 |    		                   |
                    |                            |
                    |                            |
                    |                            |
 	                 |                            |
	             NEG |----------------------------| AGND
					     |									 |
	-----------------|									 |---------------------------


	2. Compile and run this program.
	3. Follow the prompted directions of this program during execution.
	4. Vary voltage (0-2.5v) on power supply to see the CURRENT meter track
	what's being displayed by Dynamic C (4-20ma).

	Note: For best results use a 4 1/2 digit current meter
