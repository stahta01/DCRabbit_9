	Simple5wire.c

	This program is used with BL2600 series controllers.

	Description
	===========
	This program demonstrates basic initialization for a
	simple RS232 5-wire loopback displayed in STDIO window.

	Here's the typical connections for a 5 wire interface that
   would be made between controllers.

		 TX <---> RX
       RX <---> TX
		RTS <---> CTS
      CTS <---> RTS
		Gnd <---> Gnd


	Connections
	===========
	1. Connect TXC to RXC located on J17.
   2. Connect TXF to RXF located on J17.


	============
	1.  Compile and run this program.
	2.  TxF and RxF become the flow control RTS and CTS.
	3.  To test flow control, disconnect RTS from CTS while
		 running	this program.  Characters should stop printing
		 in STDIO window and continue when RTS and CTS are
		 connected again.
