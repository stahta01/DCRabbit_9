	parity.c

	This sample program is for the BL2600 series controller.

   Description
	===========
	This demonstration will repeatedly send byte values 0-127 from serial
	port F to serial port C. The program will switch between generating
   parity or not on port F. Port C will always be checking parity, so
   parity errors should occur during every other sequence.

   Note: For the sequence that does get parity errors, the errors won't
	occur for each byte received. This is because certain byte patterns
   along with the stop bit will appear to generate the proper parity for
   the UART.

   Connections
	===========
	1. Connect serial port pin TXF to serial port pin RXC.

   Instructions
	============
   1. Power-on the controller.
	2. Compile and run this program.
   3. Stop program.
	4. View STDIO window to see the test results of the sample program.
