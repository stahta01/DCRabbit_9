   This sample program is for the RCM3700 series controllers with
	prototyping boards.

	Description
	===========
	This program demonstrates how to read an ADC milli-Amp channel using
	previously defined coefficients. It will also continuously display
	the current that is being monitored.

	Instructions
	============
	1.	Make sure pins 3-5 are connected on JP5, JP6, and JP7.  Connect pins 1-2,
		3-4, 5-6, 7-8 on JP8.

	2. Connect a power supply of 0-5 volts to one of the AIN channel 3-6
		on the controller.
	3. Compile and run this program.
	4. Follow the prompted directions of this program during execution.
	5. Vary voltage (0-5v) on power supply to see the CURRENT meter track
	what is displayed by Dynamic C (4-20ma).

	Note: For best results use a 4 1/2 digit current meter
