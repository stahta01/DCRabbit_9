	ad_rddiff_ch.c

	This sample program is for the RCM3700 series controllers with
	prototyping boards.

	Description
	===========
	This program demonstrates reading one differential ADC channel
	using two known voltages and constants for that channel.
	It will also continuously display the voltage being monitored.

	This program must be compiled to Flash.

	Prototyping board connections
	=============================
	Make sure pins 1-3 are connected on JP5, JP6, and JP7.  JP8 should
	not have any pins connected.

	1. Connect 0-10 volt power supply positive terminal to AIN0 and
		the Gnd terminal to AIN1 on the proto-board.

	OR

	You will need two power supplies.
	1. Connect 0-10 volt power supply (1) to AIN0 on the controller
		and power supply (2) to AIN1.
	2.	Connect power supply grounds to GND on the controller.


	Instructions
	============
	1. Adjust power supply (1) on AIN0 to approximately 9.0 volts.
	2. If you are using a second power supply, adjust AIN1 to approximately
		1.0 volts.
	3. Compile and run this program.
	4. Enter 0 when prompted for AD channel code.
