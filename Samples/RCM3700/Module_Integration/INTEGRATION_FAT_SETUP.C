/*******************************************************************************
 		 INTEGRATION_FAT_SETUP.C

        ** NOTE ** This is the FIRST part of a 2-part sample. You will need
        to run this program before the actual sample, INTEGRATION.C, can run.
        See the section on the FAT Filesystem in INTEGRATION.C for more
        information.

		  This program copies some #ximported files into the FAT filesystem.
		  You should make sure that the FAT filesystem is already initialized
		  (see the FAT sample FMT_DEVICE.C for how to do this).

		  The sample program demonstrates the use of ZSERVER.LIB and FAT
		  filesystem functionality, with RabbitWeb dynamic HTML content,
		  all secured using SSL. This sample also supports dynamic updates
        of both the application and its resources using the Rabbit
        Download Manager (DLM) and HTTP upload capability, respectively
        (neither of these currently supports SSL security).

        This sample will only run on the RCM3300 family, RCM3700, RCM3720 and
        PowerCoreFLEX modules with serial flash.

        The DLM portion of the sample will only work on the RCM3300 family.

        ** NOTE **
        THIS IS AN ADVANCED SAMPLE THAT COMBINES MANY SOFTWARE ELEMENTS FROM
        VARIOUS MODULES. YOU WILL NEED TO HAVE ALL THE MODULES LISTED ABOVE,
        OR THIS SAMPLE WILL NOT COMPILE.

        Before running this sample, you should look at and run samples for
        ZServer, the FAT, RabbitWeb, SSL, the DLM, and HTTP upload to become
        familiar

		  Note that the RabbitWeb ZHTML pages are stored in the 8.3 FAT format
		  with the extension .ZTM.
