     Cof EchoStr.c

     This program echos a block of characters over serial port B.
     It must be run with a serial utility such as Hyperterminal.
     
     Connect RS232 cable from PC to Rabbit:
     	 Connect PC's RS232 GND to Rabbit GND
       Connect PC's RS232 TD  to Rabbit RXB
       Connect PC's RS232 RD  to Rabbit TXB
       
     Configure the serial utility for port connected to RS232, 19200 8N1.
     
     Run this program.
     Run Hyperterminal.
     Type characters into the serial utility window.
      
     This program uses the single user cofunction form of the serial read
     and write routines, which allows it to cooperatively multi-task with
     other costates when it is not actively reading or writing data. It 
     will echo a Carriage Return terminated character strings sent from 
     the serial utility back to the serial utility where they will appear 
     in its send/receive window.
