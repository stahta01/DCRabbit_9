/*******************************************************************
	flowcontrol.c

	This program is used with RCM3200 series controllers
	with prototyping boards.

	The sample library, \Samples\RCM3200\rcm3200.lib, contains a
	brdInit() function which initializes port pins. Modify this
	function to fit your application.

	Description
	===========
	This program demonstrates hardware flow control by sending a
	pattern of '*' characters out of serial port B, TXB (PC4), at
	115200 baud.

	One character at a time is received from port B and is displayed.
	In this example RXC (PC3) is configured as the CTS input, detecting
	a clear to send condition, and TXC (PC2) is configured as the RTS
	output, signaling a ready condition. This demonstration can be
	performed with either one or two core module boards.

	Refer to the function description for serBflowcontrolOn()
	for a general description on how to set up flow control lines.

	Prototyping Board Connections
	=============================

	On J5, RS232 connector, one or two boards
	-----------------------------------------

	   (CTS) RXC <-------> TXC (RTS)
	         RXB <-------> TXB
	         GND <-------> GND (two boards only)


	Instructions
	============
	1.	With two boards, run the program on the sending board and then
		disconnect and power it back up so that the program is running
		in stand-alone mode.
		Connect to the second board, which will be the receiver and
		run this same program normally.

	2.	A repeating triangular pattern should print out in
		the STDIO window. The program will periodically switch flow
		control on or off to	demonstrate the effect of no flow control
		for a very slow receiver.

	3.	You can also observe the signals with a scope to see flow
		control operating.
