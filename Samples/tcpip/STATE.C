/*
 *		my_handler is a function that is passed a MyState
 *		structure and manages the connection.  The first time
 *		the function is called on a MyState the MyState->state
 *		should be MY_INIT.  The hander does a passive open on
 *		the socket and waits for a connection.  When a 
 *		connection is established it reads the http request
 *		and header lines waiting for \r\n\r\n.  At this point
 *		the handler sends the my_response and closes the 
 *		connection.  After the connection has been confirmed
 *		closed the MyState.state is set back to MY_INIT.
 *
 *		It is important to notice how sock_mode and sock_dataready
 *		interact in MY_LISTEN, MY_GETREQ and MY_GETHEAD.  Since
 *		the socket mode is TCP_MODE_ASCII in MY_GETREQ and 
 *		MY_GETHEAD, the sock_dataready function will only return
 *		when there is a \r\n terminated string in the buffer or
 *		the buffer has been completely filled.  This allows us
 *		to call sock_gets which would normally block without
 *		worrying that it will actually block.
 *
 *		The second thing to notice is the use of sock_fastwrite
 *		in MY_SENDRSP.  This function only writes as much data
 *		as there is buffer space at the moment it is called.  
 *		This method using the offset moving towards the length
 *		can be used to make sure all of the data is sent.
