        dns2.c

        Demonstration of how to look up an IP address through a DNS
        server using the nonblocking API.  This function looks up
        multiple hostnames simultaneously.  It is organized around
        a state machine, with separate state information maintained
        for each request.

// MY_DOMAIN specifies the domain to add to a hostname in the resolving
// process.  This domain is added automatically when there is no '.' in
// the hostname to be looked up.  If the hostname does not contain a '.',
// and the first lookup fails, then it is tried again without the domain.
// Vice versa, if the hostname does contain a '.', then the domain is not
// added to the hostname until the lookup has first failed without the
// domain.
