/********************************************************************
   Samples\tcpip\multicast.c

	This sample program sends and receives heartbeat packets via
	multicast UDP sockets.  Multiple sockets can be configured to
	operate at once.  IGMP can be enabled so that the multicast
	datagrams can be routed across subnets.

	Multicasting is useful when information needs to be transmitted
	to a group of other devices.  All of these devices can be
	listening on a single multicast group.  Note that multicasting
	will not work with TCP, since TCP is an end-to-end protocol.
	Multicasting is usually used in conjunction with UDP.

 * which means that IGMPv1 will be used.  Note however, that
 * the IGMPv2 client is compatible with both IGMPv1 and IGMPv2
 * routers, so there is not much reason to set USE_IGMP to
