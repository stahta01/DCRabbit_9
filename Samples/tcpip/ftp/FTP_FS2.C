        ftp_fs2.c

        Demonstration of a simple FTP server, using the ftp library, that
        allows file uploads and deletion.  This is a version of the old
        ftp_server_full.c sample, but shows how to do it using the new
        zserver resource manager.

        If you have already run ftp_server_full.c, and uploaded some
        files, then the files you uploaded will be visible in this
        sample except that the names will be changed!  If you executed
        the FTP command "put my.file" then that file will appear in
        this sample to be in /fs2/file<n> where <n> is a number from
        1 to 255.  Unfortunately, you will not be able to tell which
        of the files relates to the files you uploaded (except by
        downloading them and comparing).

        The user "anonymous" may download the file "rabbitA.gif", but
        not "rabbitF.gif".  The user "foo" (with password "bar") may
        download "rabbitF.gif", and also "rabbitA.gif".  "foo" can also
        upload files, which will be stored in the FS2 filesystem.

        When a file is uploaded, you must call it
        /fs2/file<n>
        where <n> is a decimal number 1..255 inclusive (you choose the
        number).  From a command-line FTP client, you may use a command
        something like
          put  my.file  /fs2/file55
        or maybe
          cd /fs2
          put  my.file  file55

        Each user may execute the "dir" or "ls" command to see a listing of
        the available files.  The listing shows only the files that the
        logged-in user can access.

        When you initially connect, an ls command will show a directory
        called /fs2.  You can CD to that directory in order to list the
        files therein (and upload new ones if you are the foo user).

        This sample also shows how to create an xmem file resource
        _without_ using #ximport.  A small "README" file is generated.
