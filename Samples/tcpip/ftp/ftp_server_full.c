        ftp_server_full.c

        Demonstration of a simple FTP server, using the ftp library, that
        allows file uploads and deletion.  This is an extension of the
        ftp_server.c sample program.

        The user "anonymous" may download the file "rabbitA.gif", but
        not "rabbitF.gif".  The user "foo" (with password "bar") may
        download "rabbitF.gif", and also "rabbitA.gif", since files owned
        by the anonymous user are world-readable.  "foo" can also
        upload files, which will be stored in the FS2 filesystem.

        Each user may execute the "dir" or "ls" command to see a listing of
        the available files.  The listing shows only the files that the
        logged-in user can access.

        This sample also shows how to create an xmem file resource
        _without_ using #ximport.  A small "README" file is generated.

   NOTE:
        As of DC 8.50, this sample is deprecated.  It still works, however
        new code should use the samples\tcpip\ftp\FTP_FS2.C program
        as a starting point.

        >>> This sample makes use of the "userblock" (which is a special
        area of the program flash memory) to store the mapping between
        file names and FS2 file numbers (1-255).  This is useful
        technique if you want to use _arbitrary_ filenames.  Otherwise,
        the new (DC8.50) way of doing things is that the FS2 filesystem
        is automatically managed by the Zserver library, which creates
        filenames of the form /fs2/file1, /fs2/file2 etc.  Since the mapping
        between filenames and FS2 file numbers is fixed, this may not always
        meet requirements, however it does eliminate the need to use part
        of the userblock (or other non-volatile storage) to store the
        mapping.

        Defining FTP_USE_FS2_HANDLERS, as this sample does, will generate
        largely redundant code in the FTP server, because most of the
        same functionality has been moved to zserver.lib.
