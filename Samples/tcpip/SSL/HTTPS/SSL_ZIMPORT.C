/*******************************************************************************
        ssl_zimport.c

        This program uses the ZIMPORT.LIB library to compress web pages
        that are served by the HTTP server.  It demonstrates a couple of
        different ways in which compressed files can be used with the
        HTTP server.

		  This program has been modified to use SSL via HTTPS. See the
        SSL comments below for more information.

        ***NOTE*** This sample will NOT compile without first creating a
        certificate with the name and path specified in the #ximport line
        ("#ximport 'cert\mycert.dcc' SSL_CERTIFICATE") below. See the SSL
        Walkthrough, Section 4.1 in the SSL User's Manual for information
        on creating certificates for SSL programs.
