        ssl_cgi.c

        A simple web-counter implemented in CGI functions. This
        demonstrates how to add basic dynamic functionality to
        your pages.

		  This program has been modified to use SSL via HTTPS. See the
        SSL comments below for more information.

        ***NOTE*** This sample will NOT compile without first creating a
        certificate with the name and path specified in the #ximport line
        ("#ximport 'cert\mycert.dcc' SSL_CERTIFICATE") below. See the SSL
        Walkthrough, Section 4.1 in the SSL User's Manual for information
        on creating certificates for SSL programs.
