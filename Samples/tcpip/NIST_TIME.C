/*******************************************************************************
	Samples\TCPIP\NIST_time.c

	An example of accessing the current time in seconds via the Internet
	from a server at the National Institute for Standards and Technology
	(NIST).

	Run this program on an Ethernet-enabled board that is connected to
	the Internet to set the real-time clock to the correct time (within
	5 seconds).

	For more information about the time services available from NIST,
	visit their website at:

		http://www.boulder.nist.gov/timefreq/service/its.htm

	This program reads the current time from the NIST server as a
	one-line string in "Daytime Protocol" (RFC-867).  This format
	provides useful information like whether Daylight Saving Time is
	currently in effect and the health of the timer server. The
	string will appear something like this:

		52278 02-01-04 22:25:39 00 0 0 806.1 UTC(NIST) *

	Also available (on port 37) is "Time Protocol" (RFC-868),
	which simply provides a 32-bit value representing the number
	of seconds since January 1, 1970.

	Note that NIST actually recommends using the IP address, and
	not the domain names.  IP addresses of all current NIST time
	servers can be found at:

		http://www.boulder.nist.gov/timefreq/service/time-servers.html
