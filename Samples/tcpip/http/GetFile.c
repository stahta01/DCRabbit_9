/**
 * 	Samples/TcpIp/Http/GetFile.c
 *
 *    Note added Jan 2004: Dynamic C 8.50 introduces a much simpler
 *    way of doing what this sample does.  Basically, you would not
 *    want to do it this way any more, so this sample is effectively
 *    deprecated.  See samples\tcpip\zserver\updpages.c for the
 *    new way of doing things.  (Compare the size of the samples
 *    and consider that updpages is more flexible to see what I
 *    mean).
 *
 *    When compiling this sample under DC8.50 and above, you will see
 *    a warning message "FTP_WRITABLE_FILES is deprecated.  Set write
 *    access using zserver.lib functions.".  This warning may be
 *    ignored (but see the above paragraph).
 *
 * 	This sample allows one file to be uploaded with FTP.  The page is
 * 	then available as a web page.  This sample is rather large.  It runs
 * 	both HTTP and FTP servers.  See DATAFILE_NAME for the file name,
 * 	seen from both servers.
 *
 * 	This file is added dynamically (at runtime) by calling SSPEC's
 * 	sspec_addfsfile().  The file DATAFILE_NAME is created empty when
 * 	the program starts, and can be updated only through FTP.
 * 	Attempting to upload a file with a different name gives error
 * 	"550 File Not Found."  If the file is too big for the File System,
 * 	the client sees "452 Transfer incomplete" message.
 *
 * 	Always use the BINARY transfer mode.  Many FTP clients default to
 * 	ASCII mode.  This affects the newline chars.  If you upload a file,
 * 	then download it (PUT and GET), the size will be different.  The
 * 	file's contents have also been corrupted.
 *
 * 	From an FTP client program, you can display the file's latest contents
 * 	by doing "get data.txt -" , which sends it to STDOUT rather than
 * 	saving it locally.
 *
 * 	This application uses the file system, web server, FTP server and
 * 	zserver library.  This application is large, and uses 3 TCP server
 * 	libraries.  There are many configuration options.
 *
 * 	Since the file is stored using the File System, make sure there is
 * 	enough space there to store it!  (See below on adjust "RabbitBios.c")
 * 	When the FS refuses, fwrite() will return an error, and we return
 * 	an error indication back to the FTP server library.
 *
 *
 * 	--------------->>>  NOTE  <<<---------------
 *
 * 	(0) If you have problems accessing memory for the file system, then
 * 		recompile the bios (^Y) and run Samples\FileSystem\FS2INFO.C
 *
 * 	(1) Upon startup, if you get the error message:
 *
 * 		"ERROR: No extents have room for file system."
 *
 * 		Then you need to set aside memory for the File System.  This can
 * 		be done in one of two ways, depending on which memory area you
 * 		want the file system to use.  Modify your .\lib\bioslib\memconfig.lib
 * 		file with ONE of these changes:
 *
 * 			#define XMEM_RESERVE_SIZE 0x4000L // FLASH: Amount of space
 * 	..or..
 * 			#define FS2_RAM_RESERVE  4			 // SRAM: Number of 4096-byte blocks
 *
 * 	(2) If the server has problems uploading any files, please force a
 *			reformat.  Can do this with MY_FORCE_FORMAT define.
