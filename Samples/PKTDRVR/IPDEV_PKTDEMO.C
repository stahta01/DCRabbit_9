/******************************
ipdev_pktdemo.c

packet demo, bounces a message back and forth between a TCP/IP dev kit board
and another controller running a version of this program.
The RS485 ports of both boards should be tied together..
RS485-  <--->  RS485-
RS485+  <--->  RS485+
GND     <--->  GND  (optional)

Similar results can be obtained on boards without RS485 tranceivers
by wiring serial port D outputs together.
PC0  <--->  PC1
PC1  <--->  PC0

Hit a button on the dev board to send an initial packet

receives packets on port B
using ':' as a start character,

format is ':', then 2 bytes for length in hex, followed by data
e.g.
:13Thisisapacketofdata

Uncomment different versions of the pktBopen call below to try out different
packet schemes. Just make sure that both boards are running in the same mode.

Note: defining the label PKTB_USEPORTD causes serial port D to use
PD4 and PD5 for TX and RX which are connected to the RS485 tranceiver on
the dev kit board
