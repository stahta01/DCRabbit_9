/*******************************************************************

	toggleswitch.c

	This program is used with RCM3100 series controllers
	with prototyping boards.
	
	The sample library, rcm3100.lib, contains a brdInit()
	function which initializes port pins. Modify this
	function to fit your application.

	Description
	===========
	This program uses costatements to detect switches with
	press and release method debouncing. Corresponding LED's,
	DS1 and DS2, will turn on or off.
	
	Instructions
	============
	1. Compile and run this program.
	2. Press and release S2 switch to toggle DS1 LED on/off.
	3. Press and release S3 switch to toggle DS2 LED on/off.
