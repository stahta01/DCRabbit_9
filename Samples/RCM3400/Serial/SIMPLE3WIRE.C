	simple3wire.c

	This program is used with RCM3400 series controllers
	with prototyping boards.
	
	Description
	===========
	This program demonstrates basic initialization for a
	simple RS232 3-wire loopback displayed in STDIO window.
	
	Normally we would connect to another controller,

		Tx  <---> Rx
		Rx  <---> Tx
		Gnd <---> Gnd

	However, for this simple demonstration, make the
	following connections:
	
	Proto-board Connections
	=======================

		TxD <---> RxC
		RxD <---> TxC

	Instructions
	============
	1.  Compile and run this program.
	2.  Lower case characters are sent by TxC. RxD receives
	    the character.  TxD sends the converted uppercase
	    character to RxC and displays in STDIO.
