	daccalib.c

	This sample program is for the BL2500 series controllers.
	
	Description
	===========
	This program demonstrates how to recalibrate one single-ended analog
	output channel	using two known voltages to generate constants for that
	channel and	rewritten into user block data area.  This will overwrite
	previous factory calibrations.

	This program must be compiled to Flash.

	Connections
	===========
	Connect a voltmeter positive lead to DA0 or DA1 channels and
	the negative lead to ground at J1 pin 3 on the controller.

	Instructions
	============
	1. Compile and run this program.
	2. Follow directions in STDIO window.
