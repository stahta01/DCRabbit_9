	This sample program is intended for the BL2500 series controllers.
	
	Description
	===========
	This program reads and displays voltage and equivalent value of
	channel AD0 to STDIO window.
	
	Instructions
	============
	1. Connect a power supply of 0-3.1 volts to AD0.
	2. Compile and run this program.
	3. Follow the prompted directions of this program during execution.
