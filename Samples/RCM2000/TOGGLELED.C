     toggleled.c

     Demonstration of using the Rabbit 2000 Core Module Prototyping board and costatements

     This program will flash DS3 on the RCM 2000 Prototyping Board once per
     second (bit 2 on port A).  This program will also watch button S1 (port B
     bit 2) and toggle LED DS2 (port A bit 1) on/off when pressed.  Note that
     the button is debounced by the software.

     Port A can be set for all outputs or all inputs via the slave port control
     register (SPCTRL).  If the slave port is being used then port A should not
     be used.

     Port B bits 0-5 are always inputs, and bits 6-7 are always outputs.  If the
     slave port is being used then port B should not be used.
