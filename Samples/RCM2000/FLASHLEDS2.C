   FlashLEDS2.c

   RCM 2000 Demo board example program

   This program flashes the DS2 and DS3 LEDs on the RCM 2000
   Prototyping board (PA0 and PA1 ports on the RCM 2000).
   It also demonstrates coding with cofunctions and costatements.

//defines for the leds
#define DS2 0
#define DS3 1

// This cofunction flashes the specified led on for ontime, then off for
//  offtime, a total of flashcount times.  The additional delay at the end
//  provides a distinguishable gap in the flash pattern.
