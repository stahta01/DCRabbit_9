/*******************************************************************
	parity.c
	
	This program is used with RCM3000 series controllers
	with prototyping boards.
	
	The sample library, \Samples\RCM3000\rcm3000.lib, contains a
	brdInit() function which initializes port pins. Modify this
	function to fit your application.

	Description
	===========
	This program demonstrates use of parity modes by repeatedly
	sending byte values 0-127 from serial port B to serial port C.
	The program will switch between generating parity or not on
	port B. Port C will always be checking parity, so parity
	errors should occur during every other sequence.

	Prototyping Board Connections
	=============================
	
		On J5, RS232 connector
		-----------------------------
			
		(PC4) TXB <-------> RXC (PC3)

	         
	Instructions
	============
	1.  Run this program and observe error sequence in STDIO.
