	Samples\Jackrab\JR_Parity.c
	Demonstration of parity modes

	This demonstration will repeatedly send byte values 0-127 from serial
	port B to serial port C. Each time the program will switch between
	generating parity or not on port B. Port C will always be checking
	parity, so parity errors should occur during every other sequence.

	To perform this test you will need to connect TXB to RXC


	Note: For the sequence that does get parity errors, the errors won't
	occur for each byte received. This is due to the fact certain byte
	patterns along with the stop bit will appear to generate the proper
	parity for the UART.
