	adc_calib_external.c

 	This program is used with PowerCoreFLEX series core modules with the
   prototyping board.

	Description
	===========
	This program demonstrates how to recalibrate an external A/D channel
   using two known voltages to generate two coefficients, gain and offset,
   which will be rewritten	into simulated EEPROM in flash. The program
   will then will also continuously	display the voltage that has been
   calibrated.

   Power supply Connections
   ========================
   1. Connect the positive power supply lead to the A/D channel input
      located on J3 pin 7 on the prototyping board.
	2.	Connect the negative power supply lead to GND located on J3 pin 8
      on the prototyping board.

	Instructions
	============
	1. Compile and run this program.
	2. Follow the prompted directions of this program during execution.
	3. Voltage will be continuously displayed the external A/D channel.
