	adc_rd_external.c

 	This program is used with PowerCoreFLEX series core modules with the
   prototyping board.

	Description
	===========
   Reads and displays the voltage of the external A/D located on the
   PowerCoreFLEX prototyping board. The voltage is calculated from coefficients
   read from simulated EEPROM in flash.

   Power supply Connections
   ========================
   1. Connect the positive power supply lead to the A/D channel input
      located on J3 pin 7 on the prototyping board.
	2.	Connect the negative power supply lead to GND located on J3 pin 8
      on the prototyping board.

	Instructions
	============
	1. Compile and run this program.
	2. Follow the prompted directions of this program during execution.
	3. Voltage will be continuously displayed for the external A/D channel.
