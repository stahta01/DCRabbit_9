	parity.c

 	This program is used with PowerCoreFLEX series core modules with the
   prototyping board.

   Description
	===========
	This demonstration will repeatedly send byte values 0-127 from serial
	port E to serial port F. The program will switch between generating
   parity or not on port E. Port F will always be checking parity, so
   parity errors should occur during every other sequence.

   Note: For the sequence that does get parity errors, the errors won't
	occur for each byte received. This is because certain byte patterns
   along with the stop bit will appear to generate the proper parity for
   the UART.

   Connections
	===========
   1. Jumper TXE to RXF together located on J1 pins 3 and 4 with
   	using the 0.1 spacing shunt.

   Instructions
	============
   1. Power-on the controller.
	2. Compile and run this program.
   3. Stop program.
	4. View STDIO window to see the test results of the sample program.
