	Samples\Rabbit3000\qd_test.c

	This program is used with Rabbit 3000 based controllers.

	Description
	===========
	This program demonstrates the input capture system to
	measure relative phase of detectors in a quadrature
	decoding arrangement.

	Connect PF0 to PF7 to get input capture on PF0 QD input
	phase of quadrature signals will be printed to STDOUT
	along with count.

	Connections
	===========
	Connect a quadrature encoder or a pair of switches
	to the QD input pair.

								  PF7 <--+
								  			|
		Channel 1: 	A <---> PF0 <--+
						B <---> PF1

	If you are using an RCM3000 prototyping board, a simple
	circuit would be to connect on the proto-board:

					  	+-> PF7
					  	|
		Channel 1: 	+-> PF0 <---> PG1 (operates switch S2)
							 PF1 <---> PG0 (operates switch S3)

	Instructions
	============
	1. Make circuit connections as above.
	2.	Compile and run this program.
	3. If using switches to test, press and release the
		first switch and then the second switch directly
		after the first.
