/**********************************************************
	Samples\Rabbit3000\qd_test.c
	
	This program is used with Rabbit 3000 based controllers.

	Description
	===========
	This program demonstrates the quadature decoder peripheral
	on the Rabbit 3000 processor.
	
	Both channels are enabled and the current count of each
	is printed to STDOUT.  Additionally, channel 1 is zeroed
	out every five seconds to demonstrate the use of the
	qd_zero() function.

	Connections
	===========
	Connect a quadrature encoder or a pair of switches
	to each of the two QD input pairs:

		Channel 1: 	A <---> PF0
						B <---> PF1

		Channel 2:	A <---> PF2
						B <---> PF3

	If you are using an RCM3000 prototyping board, a simple
	circuit would be to connect on the proto-board:
	
		Channel 1:	PF0 <---> PG1 (operates switch S2)
						PF1 <---> PG0 (operates switch S3)
	or
							
		Channel 2:	PF2 <---> PG1 (operates switch S2)
						PF3 <---> PG0 (operates switch S3)
		
	Instructions
	============
	1. Make circuit connections as above.
	2.	Compile and run this program.
	3. If using switches to test, press and release the
		first switch and then the second switch directly
		after the first.
