    This program is intended to be run on a DeviceMate.  It runs a web
    server, and will accept variable updates from a target processor.
    These variables are included in .shtml pages that the DeviceMate
    serves.  Hence, these variables allow a simple means of having
    dynamic content in web pages.  See the .shtml file
    devmate_var.shtml for how these variables are included in a
    web page.
   
    See var.c and var_ucos.c for the Target Processor programs
    intended to be run with this program.
