/**********************************************************************
   FS_FLASH.C
  
   This is the same as FS.C, except it
   utilizes a flash-filesystem in the 1st (program)
   flash device, as is appropriate for the RCM2200.
  
   A change to the BIOS is necessary, to reserve some
   of the first flash for this use. Find the line:
  		#define XMEM_RESERVE_SIZE 0x0000L
   and change it to:
  		#define XMEM_RESERVE_SIZE 0x8000L
   to reserve 32K of space for the flash. Not all
   of this space will be used in this example, to
   account for the System IDBlock, and rounding
   error of flash sector boundaries.

   Due to the limited space in the first flash, it is important to use
   a flash that has a sufficient number of sectors avaliable for the
   filesystem. Using a device with a sector size of around 256 bytes is
   ideal. If a large-sector flash device is necessary, it is highly
   recomended to use a 2nd flash device to store the filesystem, as
   shown by the example programs in the /RCM2250 directory.
