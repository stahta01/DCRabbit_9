/*******************************************************************************

        Samples\RCM2100\ethcore2.c

        This program takes anything that comes in on PORT and sends it
        out serial port c.  It uses SW2 as a signal that the connection
        should be closed and PA0 as an indication that there is an open
        connection.  You could change SW2 and PA0 to something that your
        application controls.

        It is important to note that a TCP/IP connection that it is
        difficult to detect a broken connection when there is no data
        moving across the link.  It is recommended that you occasionally
        send data across the link or implement timeouts to handle this
        situation.
