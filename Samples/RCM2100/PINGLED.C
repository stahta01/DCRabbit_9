/*******************************************************************************
        pingled.c

        ICMP demonstration, by pinging a remote host.

        This sample program is an adaptation of samples/tcpip/ping.c.  It
        has been modified for the RCM2100 to flash LEDs on the prototyping
        board.  It flashes DS2 when it sends a ping and flashes DS3 when
        it receives a ping response.

        To use this program modify the MY_IP_ADDRESS, MY_NETMASK, MY_GATEWAY,
        and MY_NAMESERVER to the appropriate settings for the network.  Then
        change PING_WHO to the host you want to ping.  The MY_NAMESERVER
        define is only necessary when you are specifing PING_WHO by name
        instead of by IP address.

        You can modify the PING_DELAY define to change the amount of time
        in milliseconds between the outgoing pings.

        If you would like to see the incoming ping replies, uncomment the
        VERBOSE define.
