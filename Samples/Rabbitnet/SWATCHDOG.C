   swatchdog.c

	This sample program is for any RabbitNet board.

	Description
	===========
	This program demonstrates setting and hitting the software
   watchdog on a RabbitNet device using costatements.

   This program will first look for a device directly connected to
   each controller port using rn_device().  The last device found
	will be used.

  	The software watchdog will be set for 2.5 seconds. The watchdog
   will be hit at every increasing time out until the time out is
   past 2.5 seconds.  A software reset will occur and the software
   watchdog will be disabled.

	Connections
	===========
   Connect RabbitNet and power supply cables to the controller
   and RN boards as described in the RabbitNet Manual.

	Instructions
	============
	1. Compile and run this program.
   2. Watch busy counter and delay time increase until the display
   	for software reset appears at 2500 ms.
