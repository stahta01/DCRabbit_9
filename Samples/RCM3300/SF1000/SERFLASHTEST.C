/********************************************************************

	serflashtest.c

	This program is used with RCM3300 series controllers and
	prototyping boards.

	An optional SF1000 Serial Flash card is required to run this
   demonstration. The card is installed onto the prototyping board.


   Description
	===========
	This simple sample program demonstrates how to read and write
   from the SF1000 Serial Flash.  Please refer to SF1000 User
   Manual for further reference.

   Serial port D lines, TXD (PC0) and RXD (PC1), and serial clock
   line CLKD (PF0) are used.  PD3 is used as the chip select line.
   These lines are configured below.


	Instructions
	============
   1. Plug SF1000 Serial Flash card into RCM3300 prototyping board
   	on connector J11, matching pin 1 on each connector.

	2. Compile and run this program.

	3. You should see in STDIO Window:

		     "This serial flash test passed"

      This indicates a write and read were successful.

      OR

		     "This serial flash test failed"

      This indicates a write and read were not successful.
