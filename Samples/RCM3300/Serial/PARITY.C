/*******************************************************************
	parity.c

	This program is used with RCM3300 series controllers
	and prototyping boards.

	Description
	===========
	This program demonstrates use of parity modes by repeatedly
	sending byte values 0-127 from TXE (serial port E) to RXF
   (serial port F).
	The program will switch between generating parity or not on
	port E. Port F will always be checking parity, so parity
	errors should occur during every other sequence.

	Prototyping Board Connections
	=============================

		On the RS232 connector
		-----------------------------

		 TXE <-------> RXF


	Instructions
	============
	1.  Run this program and observe error sequence in STDIO.
