	toggleswitch.c

	This program is used with RCM3300 series controllers and
	prototyping boards.

	Description
	===========
	This program uses costatements to detect switches with
	press and release method debouncing. Corresponding LED's,
	DS2 and DS3, will turn on or off.

	Instructions
	============
	1. Compile and run this program.
	2. Press and release S2 switch to toggle DS3 LED on/off.
	3. Press and release S3 switch to toggle DS4 LED on/off.
