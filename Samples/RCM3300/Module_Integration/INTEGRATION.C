/*******************************************************************************
        INTEGRATION.C

        ** NOTE ** This is the SECOND part of a 2-part sample. You will need
        to run the INTEGRATION_FAT_SETUP.C sample program before this program
        can run. See the section on the FAT Filesystem below for more
        information.

		  This sample program demonstrates the use of ZSERVER.LIB and FAT
		  filesystem functionality, with RabbitWeb dynamic HTML content,
		  all secured using SSL. This sample also supports dynamic updates
        of both the application and its resources using the Rabbit
        Download Manager (DLM) and HTTP upload capability, respectively
        (neither of these currently supports SSL security).

        This sample will only run on the RCM3300 family, RCM3700, RCM3720 and
        PowerCoreFLEX modules with serial flash.

        The DLM portion of this sample will only work on RCM3300 family boards
        that are equipped with on-board serial flash.

        ** NOTE **
        THIS IS AN ADVANCED SAMPLE THAT COMBINES MANY SOFTWARE ELEMENTS FROM
        VARIOUS MODULES. YOU WILL NEED TO HAVE ALL THE MODULES LISTED ABOVE,
        OR THIS SAMPLE WILL NOT COMPILE.

        Before running this sample, you should look at and run samples for
        ZServer, the FAT, RabbitWeb, SSL, the DLM, and HTTP upload to become
        familiar

        Upon running the sample (using Dynamic C or the DLM on an RCM 3300 to
        upload the program), the humidity monitor will be displayed. This
        page is accessible via plain HTTP or over SSL-secured HTTPS. Clicking
        on the administrator link will bring up the admin page, which is
        automatically secured using SSL and a username and password. The
        following are used for the username and password by default:
	        USERNAME: myadmin PASSWORD: myadmin
        The admin page demonstrates some RabbitWeb capabilities, and provides
        access to the HTTP upload page. Clicking the upload link will bring
        up the HTTP upload page, which allows you to choose new files for
        both the humidity monitor and the admin page. Your browser may prompt
        you again for your username and password, these are the same as above.

        Note that the upload page is a static page included in the program
        flash and can only be updated by recompiling and downloading the
        application. This is so that you cannot accidentally change the upload
        page, possibly restricting yourself from performing future updates.

        To try out rhe update capability, click the upload link on the admin
        page and choose a simple tezt file to replace monitor.ztm. Open another
        browser window and load the main page. You will see your text file has
        replaced the humidity monitor. To restore the monitor, go back to the
        other window, click back to go to the upload page again, and choose
        HUMIDITY_MONITOR.ZHTML to replace monitor.ztm and click Upload.
        Refreshing the other window will now show that the page has been
        restored. You have successfully updated and restored your application's
        files remotely!

        ** NOTE ** This sample, since it uses the FAT, has a special shutdown
        procedure that should be followed before powering off to prevent
        potential corruption of FAT files. This procedure involves pressing
        and holding a switch on the protoboard (S2 on the 3300, S1 on the 3700)
        for a specified number of seconds. Once the shutdown procedure has run,
        an LED will blink rapidly, indicating that it is now safe to turn the
        device off. This procedure can be modified by the user to provide any
        application-specific shutdown tasks desired.

        ** NOTE ** HTTP upload and SSL currently do not work together, so
        compiling this program will generate a serious warning. However, we
        are not using HTTP upload over SSL, so we can ignore the warning. For
        convenience, we have included a macro, HTTP_UPLOAD_SSL_SUPRESS_WARNING,
        which will supress the warning message.

        THE FOLLOWING SECTIONS DESCRIBE MODULE-SPECIFIC ISSUES

		  --== RabbitWeb ==--
        The basic sample is modified from a RabbitWeb sample based on a
        humidity monitor. It demonstrates some simple #web variable
        registration along with some authentication features.

        Note that the RabbitWeb ZHTML pages are stored in the 8.3 FAT format
		  with the extension .ZTM. See the pages "pages\humidity_monitor.zhtml"
        and "pages\humidity_admin.zhtml" for the corresponding ZHTML pages.

        --== FAT Filesystem ==--
		  ** NOTE ** This is the second of a 2-part sample.  The other part
        (run first) is INTEGRATION_FAT_SETUP.C, which will setup the
        appropriate files for this sample (copies #ximported files into
        the FAT).

        This sample uses the FAT filesystem for serving up the RabbitWeb
        pages. Using the FAT also allows us to remotely update these
        resources using the HTTP upload capability of the HTTP server.

        --== ZServer ==--
        All resources are accessed using ZServer functionality, which provides
        a friendly, uniform interface to file systems and resources. ZServer
        also provides authentication for protecting those resources.

        --== SSL ==--
		  This program uses SSL via HTTPS. See the SSL comments below for
        more information.

	     See the SSL Walkthrough for information on creating certificates
        for SSL programs.

        --== HTTP Upload ==--
		  This sample supports remote updating of resources (files) via the web.
        It uses the default HTTP upload CGI (HTTP.LIB) along with a custom
        upload page (pages/UPLOAD.HTML). The upload page is accessible from
        the admin page.

        --== DLM Support ==--
        If you are using an RCM33xx that's equipped with on-board serial flash,
        you can make this sample into a DLP for use with the Remote Application
        Update DLM. This is simply done by uncommenting a macro define below.
        Search for the comment DLP SPECIFIC CHANGE to see the portions of code
        added when DLP support is enabled.
