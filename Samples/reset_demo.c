/*****************************************************

	Samples\reset_demo.c

	Demonstration of using Rabbit reset functions and
	protected variables.

	This program will print out to serial port B
	why the last reset occurred, then cause either a
	watchdog timeout or a soft reset according to a
	protected counter.

	To properly run this demo, compile it to flash,
	disconnect the programming cable, connect serial
	port B to your computer at 19200 baud, and hit the
	reset button (or cycle the board's power).  The
	controller will then start running the program.
	A hard (power fail) reset can be forced by pressing
	the reset button or cycling the power.

	NOTE 1:  It is necessary to disconnect the target
	controller's programming cable in order for the
	target to run the loaded program after reset.  If
	not disconnected from the programming cable, after
	reset the target controller executes its bootstrap
	loader loop instead of the previously loaded code.

	NOTE 2:  Loss of target communication will result
	when a target controller is power-cycled or reset
	while it is communicating with Dynamic C when
	running in debug mode.
