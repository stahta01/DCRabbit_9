      Example of a cofunction with an everytime block in it.
 
      This example demonstrates the correct everytime behaviour
      inside a cofunction.  The everytime block is executed before
      each continuation call of a cofunction.  In this case the
      "i" variable is reset to 4 each time (except the first) CofTest 
      is called.
