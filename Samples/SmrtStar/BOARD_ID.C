	This sample program is for the Smart Star series controllers.
	
	This program will detect the controller type that you have (via product
	ID) and will display that information in the STDIO window. Here's the
	controllers product information. 

	Board Setup:
	------------------------
	1. Connect a +24v power source to the backplane PWR connector
	   as follows:

	   PS     	Backplane
	   --			-----------------
	   +24v		+RAW Terminal  
	   GND      GND Terminal

	0x0502			SR9100...25Mhz Smart Star, no ethernet
	0x0C00			SR9150...22MHz SmartStar CPU, ethernet
	0x0C01			SR9160...22MHz SmartStar CPU, no ethernet
