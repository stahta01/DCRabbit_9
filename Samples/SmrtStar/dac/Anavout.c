	anavout.c
   
	This sample program is used with Smart Star Digital to Analog cards,
	specifically for 0-10V and +/-10V DAC boards.
	
	This program outputs equivalent voltage value of a DAC channel.
	Coefficients are read once from the DAC's EEPROM to compute equivalent
	voltages.
	
	Instructions
	------------
	Connect a voltage meter to an output channel.
	Compile and run this program.
	Follow the prompted directions of this program during execution.
