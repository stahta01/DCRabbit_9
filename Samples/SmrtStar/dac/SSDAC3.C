/***************************************************************************
	ssdac3.c
	
	This sample program is used with Smart Star products, specifically
	for the 4-20mA DAC board.

	!!!Caution this will overwrite the calibration constants set at the
	   factory.
	   
	This program demonstrates how to recalibrate an DAC channel using
	two known currents and defines the two coefficients, gain and offset,
	which will be rewritten into the DAC's EEPROM. 

	Instructions:
	Connect a current meter to an output channel.
	Compile and run this program.
	Follow the prompted directions of this program during execution.
	
	Note:  When entering current values, milli-Amp values will produce
	a milli-Amp value. Similarly, Amp values will produce an Amp value.
