	ssdac1.c
	
	This sample program is used with Smart Star products, specifically
	for 0-10V and +/-10V DAC boards.

	!!!Caution this will overwrite the calibration constants set at the
	   factory.
	   
	This program demonstrates how to recalibrate an DAC channel using
	two known voltages and defines the two coefficients, gain and offset,
	which will be rewritten into the DAC's EEPROM. 

	Instructions:
	Connect a voltage meter to an output channel.
	Compile and run this program.
	Follow the prompted directions of this program during execution.
