*****************************************************************
VERSION 2.12

NEW FEATURES
 - Added PC compatible support for FAT 12 partitions.
 - Added support for DC10.xx compiler system.
 - Added support for RCM4000 and RCM4200 core modules.

OTHER FUNCTIONAL CHANGES

BUG FIXES

 - Defect #1 (DC9.50) fixed. Divide by zero caused by underlying
   serial flash initialization bug.  Added error checking to
   FAT_shell.c sample.
 - Defect #25 (DC9.50) fixed. Divide by zero caused by underlying
   serial flash initialization bug.  Added error checking to
   FAT_shell.c sample.

   caused by recent addition of ipreg setting/storage to the
   sf_enable and sf_disable routines. This addition caused
   corruption of the SP reg within these routines. Added a local
   variable to save ipreg in and SP adjustment to correct issue.

   to correct problem with certain partition sizes being assigned
   FAT 16 status when they should have been FAT 12.  Added check

   always updates the correct IBxCR register shadow."
 - Defect #81489 fixed. Cache layer caused errant writes to the
   storage device whenever a marker header (used with directory
   entries) was released.  This caused writes to occur during
   read operations in several frequently occuring situations.

 - Added support for BL2600 variants equipped with nand flash.
 - Added support for RCM3365 and RCM3375 with hotswap-safe
   hardware.
 - Added unique volume labeling for xD cards and other changes to
   allow hot-swapping using fat_autoMount().
 - Addded transparent mutex function wrappers to allow more than
   one uC/OS-II task to do FAT operations. This includes a new
   API function fat_InitUCOSMutex().
 - Added new API function nf_XD_Detect() to detect xD card
   presence.
 - Added samples to demonstrate hot-swapping and FAT - uC/OS-II
   usage.

OTHER FUNCTIONAL CHANGES

   when busy waiting on flash write/erase cycle. Caused invalid
   sectors in read cache, especially if using multiple devices.

   flash when busy waiting on flash write/erase cycle. Caused
   sectors to not always be written to the NAND flash when
   flushed from the write-thru cache. Was more frequent when

******************************************************

NEW FEATURES
 - Added fat_AutoMount function for enhanced board specific
   initialization.

BUG FIXES (Library)
 - Defect #81292 fixed. Split with 1 cluster free at the same
   time the directory expands creates file in wrong place and
   does not expand subdirectory properly.
 - Defect #81293 fixed. Size of preallocation limited to 32767
   clusters and incorrectly wraps and gives wrong results on
   requests above this amount.
 - Defect #81294 fixed. Split followed by write and then reset
   loses length on new file.
 - Defect #81295 fixed. Exceeding the remaining space on the
   device sometimes gives errant -22 code.
 - Defect #81296 fixed. FAT file system write through cache IDs
   don't distinguish between multiple devices correctly.

OTHER FUNCTIONAL CHANGES

*****************************************************************
*****************************************************************
VERSION 1.02

NEW FEATURES
 - Full power-loss recovery on all operations with battery
   back-up.

BUG FIXES (Library)
 - Deleting/truncating a file can leave an unlinked chain in FAT
   table if power is lost during the operation. Clusters cannot
   be recovered for use without reformatting the partition.
 - Truncating a file to small sizes (less than one cluster) can
   corrupt the file size.
 - fat_Split not truncating original file, it is cross-linked
   with new file.
 - Cluster pointer not wrapping correctly when end of device is
   reached, can lock system.  Corrupts chain being allocated.
 - fat_FormatPartition is overlapping the two FAT tables. Entries
   for clusters 0 & 1 in the second table are written to the end
   of the first table, locking out 2 clusters.
 - Free space in partition structure not calculated or maintained
   correctly.
 - Full file system + write or append to file yields bad state.
   From there on you can't delete files or directories.
 - Allocation problem with FAT 12 can cause an extra cluster to
   be allocated when not requested.  Occurs when FAT table entry
   spans two sectors.

BUG FIXES (Samples)
 - fat_NonBlk.c creates non-existent errors when executed, not
   handling one of the return codes correctly.
 - fat_Shell.c rd command not working properly if file contains
   null characters.
