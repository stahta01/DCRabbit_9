DESCRIPTION:
   This file contains customizable pin configurations for the
   Compact Flash WiFi Interposer board (included with WiFi Add-on kit).

                     into this new file to be distributed with standard

 /*Interposer Pin configuration Macros: The INTERPx_ prefix (with a 1 or a 2 for x)
   refers to a particular WiFi interposer interface that the macro affects, in a possible
   2 interposer plugin configuration.  Most developers will only be using one WiFi
   interposer board plugin, so only the INTERP0_ macros will need to be changed, when
   hardware modifications to the interposer board have been made by the developer.
