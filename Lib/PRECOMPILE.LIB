/*** BeginHeader Precompile **********************************/
/* Functions to be compiled immediately after the bios
 * (precompiled) should be placed in a comma separated list
 * in a #precompile directive.  Precompiles are useful for
 * decreasing the download time when developing your program,
 * since these functions will be compiled and downloaded with
 * the BIOS, rather than each time you compile and download
 * your program.
 *
 * LIMITATIONS:
 *      - Precompiled functions must be marked
 *        nodebug.
 *      - Any functions to be precompiled must be in
 *        a library, and that library must be included
 *        either in the BIOS using a #use, or recursively
 *        included by those libraries. To precompile
 *        your own functions, #use your library in this
 *        file, before the #precompile directives.
 *        *Be careful of functions that are in
 *        libraries that are conditionally included.
 *      - Internal BIOS functions will precompile,
 *        but will not result in any improvement, since
 *        these functions are already downloaded with
 *        the BIOS.
 *      - Libraries that require the user to define
 *        parameters before being used can only be
 *        precompiled if those dependencies are resolved
 *        prior to the #precompile statement. An example
 *        of this is shown below.
 *        parameters before they can be included.
 *      - Function chains and functions using segment
 *        chains cannot be precompiled.
 *      - Precompiled functions will be placed in xmem,
 *        unless specifically marked root.
 *      - All dependencies must be resolved (Macros,
 *        variables, other functions, etc) before a
 *        function can be precompiled. This may involve
 *        precompiling other functions first.
 *
 * Some examples of legal precompiled functions
 * are listed below.
