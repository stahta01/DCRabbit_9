   Installation

   Unzip the archive to a location on your hard drive. The patch is structured
   by Dynamic C version and as an overlay to your existing installation. 
   To use the patch, simply copy the patch over your existing version of 
   Dynamic C to replace your existing files with the patched versions of the 
   same.

   Recompililation Required

   Recompilation of your existing application is required for all affected
   products listed in the table above. In other words, if your product's part 
   number is at the revision listed or a later revision, then you will need to
   build a new binary image with the patched version of Dynamic C. Note that
   the binary image will work with both new revision and older revisions of the
   products.

   Previous Versions of Dynamic C

   Customers using previous versions of Dynamic C must upgrade to the 
   version listed in the table above in order to use the patch.
