PATCH UPDATE 2 FOR DYNAMIC C 9.62

NEW FEATURES

- The Lib\NandFlash\nflash.lib driver library has been updated with support for
  Micron/Numonyx/ST NANDxxxW3A nand flash devices. Previously supported nand
  flash devices, used on e.g. RCM3365 and RCM3900 boards, have been discontinued
  and are no longer available. As of 01-Dec-2012, new production e.g. RCM3365
  and RCM3900 boards will have a Micron/Numonyx/ST NAND256W3A (32MB) nand flash
  device installed.

  Custom applications which use nand flash, whether based on e.g. RCM3365,
  RCM3900 boards or a custom nand flash board design, should be recompiled using
  Dynamic C 9.62 with this PATCH UPDATE 2 installed in order to support the new,
  increased selection of small-block nand flash devices.

BUG PATCHES

Compiler Bugs

GUI Bugs

Library Bugs
- Defect 20311 patched. On boards such as the OP6700 or TCP/IP Dev Kit, the MAC
  address was not being read from the serial EEPROM.
- Defect 20900 patched. When UDP send functionality's ARP resolution fails it
  now correctly releases its ARP table handle.
- Defect 31569 patched. When ARP.LIB functionality detects an IP conflict with
  a remote host, the response is now correct for either gratuitous or normal
  ARP requests.
- Defect 31780 patched. Multicast ARP table entries are no longer purged.
- Defect 42241 patched. Rabbit now responds correctly to ARP probes (i.e. "who
  has IP w.x.y.z?" Ethernet broadcast) from source IP 0.0.0.0.
- Defect 42695 patched. A two-flash (i.e. 2*256K flash devices on board) DLP now
  has the full 256K secondary flash size available for program code.
- Defect DC-4 patched. HTTPC.LIB's HTTPC post functionality, following a
  successful post operation, sets HTTPC_STATE_HEADER state.
- Defect DC-19 patched. The Asix PHY link-fail bug work-around, broken in PATCH
  UPDATE 1 FOR DYNAMIC C, is fixed. Ethernet link is restored within a few
  seconds of cable reconnection after either a lengthy (approximately 20 minutes
  or more) cable disconnection or a series of repeated quick cable
  disconnection, reconnection events.
- Defect RCM-7 patched. Prevent reset of a TCP connection's keep-alive timer in
  the case that a previously connected remote host attempts to establish a new
  connection which re-uses its previous TCP connection's source and destination
  IP addresses and port numbers.

Sample Program Bugs
- Defect 42746 patched. The Samples\xalloc_stats.c standard sample program no
  longer reports an error due to calling xalloc_stats() with a zero parameter.

RFU Bugs

OTHER FUNCTIONAL CHANGES

- In tcp_config.lib, the _PRIMARY_STATIC_IP and _PRIMARY_NETMASK macro
  definitions are now conditional to prevent warnings when overridden by custom
  definition(s). The default definitions remain the same, "10.10.6.100" and
  "255.255.255.0" respectively.

- Defining DO_NOT_WARN_ON_RT_FULLDUPLEX before "#use dcrtcp.lib" prevents a
  warning in REALTEK.LIB when RT_FULLDUPLEX is also defined.

PATCH UPDATE 1 FOR DYNAMIC C 9.62

NEW FEATURES

- This patch includes a previous patch to add BL2600Q (an RCM3900 installed into
  a BL2600 base board) support to Dynamic C 9.62. See README_BL2600Q_PATCH.TXT
  in the main Dynamic C 9.62 installation folder for details.

- Two different new behaviors are available after a BIN file is loaded to the
  Rabbit target via the RFU:
    1) When RFU_BIN_WAIT_FOR_RESET is defined, after the BIN file is loaded via
       the RFU the application will not run until the programming cable is
       disconnected and followed by a hardware reset.
    2) When RFU_BIN_WAIT_FOR_RUN_MODE is defined and RFU_BIN_WAIT_FOR_RESET is
       not defined, after the BIN file is loaded via the RFU the application
       will not run until the programming cable is disconnected.
  An easy place to define the desired new macro to control BIN file behavior is
  in Dynamic C's Project Options' Defines box. Note that when neither
  RFU_BIN_WAIT_FOR_RESET nor RFU_BIN_WAIT_FOR_RUN_MODE are defined, Dynamic C
  9.62 behavior is per its usual. Also note that compiling in debug mode when
  either of these macros is defined will result in a "helpful" error message.

- Added HTTP client support via the new Lib\tcpip\httpc.lib library. See also
  the new Samples\tcpip\http\http_client.c sample program.

Library Bugs
- Defect 21640 patched. Stack(s) are now allocated more space-efficiently, using
  _xalloc's alignment capability. Also, the correct value is assigned to the
  global BaseOfStacks1 variable.
- Defect 24080 patched. SERLINK.LIB's ppplink_asymap() function now respects the
  peer's asynchronous serial escape character table setting.
- Defect 24260 patched. Updated WIEGAND.LIB's wiegand_init function to always
  call the appropriate SetVectExternX000 and the SetVectIntern functions.
- Defect 24421 patched. The errmsg.ini file and the ERRNO.LIB and ERRORS.LIB
  libraries are patched to add ESHAREDBUSY (240) and EFUNCBLK (243) error codes
  and to make the EFATMUTEX (300) error code consistent throughout.

  and DelaySec function help descriptions.
- Defect 24475 patched. Improved the COSTATE.LIB library's IntervalTick,
  IntervalMs, and IntervalSec function help descriptions.
- Defect 24477 patched. The COSTATE.LIB library's DelayTicks function is patched
  to accept a long type ticks delay parameter. This matches all other Delay* and
  Interval* firsttime functions.
- Defect 24743 patched. The PowerCoreFLEX.LIB library's switchIn function now
  causes a -ERR_BADPARAMETER run time error to occur if its swin parameter is
  invalid.

  function allows multiple PPP interfaces (e.g on serial ports B and D) to work
  correctly.
- Defect 25307 patched. SERLINK.LIB's serial ISR now preserves XPC.
- Defect 25613 patched. The REALTEK.LIB's internal emu9346_clk function is
  updated to prevent the possibility of an asm jump out of range error.
- Defect 25727 patched. The RNET.LIB rn_find function now correctly searches for
  Rabbitnet device(s) on the specified RabbitNet port(s).
- Defect 25750 patched. The FAT.LIB library's fat_Truncate function's ordering
  of FAT code checks is updated to work around a truncation bug caused by a
  mixed-type comparison (long vs. unsigned long) of the negative FAT code vs.
  the non-negative current file position.
- Defect 25944 patched. The WEIGAND.LIB library's weigand_init function now
  correctly supports either of the input capture 1 or 2 options on Rabbit 3000
  targets.
- Defect 26212 patched. The RNET_KEYIF.LIB library's rn_keyUnget void function
  no longer attempts to return a value.
- Defect 27167 patched. The BOOTP.LIB library's dhcp_init function now preserves

  reference to a non-existent RN_CFG_RCM39.LIB.
- Defect 27384 patched. The Remote Application Update (RAU) now correctly
  supports customizing the number of DLP images that may be stored.
- Defect 27692 patched. The IX register's content is now preserved by SYS.LIB's
  updateTimers function.
- Defect 28314 patched. The STDIO.LIB library's snprintf function now always
  null-terminates its output buffer.
- Defect 28403 patched. The RCM3300 Remote Application Update (RAU) DLM / DLP
  shared network information save / restore feature now works correctly.
- Defect 28846 patched. Rabbit boards equipped with an ASIX 10/100 Ethernet
  device and connected to some models of network switch (e.g. Foundry Fastedge
  X448, Linksys EF3124, Linksys EZXS55W) now reliably recover link after the
  Ethernet cable is disconnected then reconnected.
- Defect 29196 patched. UCOS2.LIB's ISIntExit() is patched to prevent possible
  errant task switching if OSLockNesting && --bios_intnesting == OSLockNesting.
- Defect 30070 patched. Mem.lib's _rs_xalloc_init() function is patched to work
  around a Dynamic C compiler ORG table problem with non-flagged battery
  backable RAM in "Compile to Flash, Run in RAM" compile mode.
- Defect 30489 patched. The BL26xx.LIB's brdInit function now handles PD2
  correctly for the BL2600Q's SD card detect. (A previous patch to Dynamic C
  9.62 was provided to support the BL2600Q - an RCM3900 core on a BL2600 base
  board.)
- Defect 31863 patched. The GRAPHIC.LIB's TextBorderInit() function help is
  updated to reflect a GRAPHIC.LIB code patch to correctly handle either a NULL
  or an empty (i.e. "") string passed in as the title parameter.
- Defect 32281 patched. FTP_CLIENT.LIB is updated to work with the IIS FTP
  server by discarding any extra arguments in the response to Rabbit's QUIT.
- Defect 32434 patched. SDFLASH.LIB's sdspi_get_csd() function now supports SD
  cards that use CRC7 instead of CRC16 in their CSD block.
- Defect 32470 patched. Serial data flash sizes in SFLASH.LIB's sf_devtable[]
  information array now reflect the full number of pages on each of the
  supported devices.
- Defect 32937 patched. Corrupted FAT MBR information no longer causes a divide
  by zero run time exception.
- Defect 33853 patched. All serial ports' initialization in SERLINK.LIB now
  reads SxDR four times, which suffices to clear any possible pending data in
  any serial port.
- Defect 34017 patched. ZSERVER.LIB's sspec_changefv() no longer truncates
  maximum-length string type form variables to be one less than the maximum
  specified length.
- Defect 34070 patched. In non-blocking FAT mode, a fat_Truncate() call to
  within a file's first cluster followed by a fat_Close() call no longer hangs
  with a permanent -EBUSY result.
- Defect 35373 patched. Rabbit applications which do not have a battery-backed
  RTC may see an incorrect result at start up from the BIOS's bios_divider19200
  and freq_divider calculations. To prevent this baud rate miscalculation,
  non-battery-backed RTC Rabbit applications should now be compiled with
  ROBUST_NON_BB_BAUD_RATE_CALC added into Dynamic C's Project Options' Defines
  box.
- Defect 38754 patched. RS232.LIB's ISRs now perform ipres as the very last
  op-code before returning to pre-interrupt code. This prevents any possibility
  of contributing to gradual stack overflow.
- Defect 38777 patched. When uC/OS-II is used, SERLINK.LIB's ISR now prevents
  task switching while interrupt processing continues with reenabled interrupts.
- Defect 39302 patched. In modbus_master.lib, custom _initMBMpacket()
  functionality is restored for TCP-only Modbus master boards. A library
  function stub is now provided, along with function help.
- Defect 39386 patched. Updated HTTPC.LIB's httpc_post_ext() and
  httpc_postx_ext() functions to prevent errant compile-time errors.

Sample Program Bugs

  sample program's instructions for erasing a serial flash's previous partition
  information now specify clearing pages 0 through 5, inclusive.
- Defect 26635 patched. The stock RabbitLink\clear_param.c (utility) and
  RabbitLink\download.c (firmware) programs now compile cleanly, without
  warnings or errors.
- Defect 26636 patched. The RabbitLink\download.c (firmware) program now
  compiles without error when its USE_DHCP macro is commented out.
- Defect 27230 patched. The Modbus (former module) Samples\Modbus standard
  sample programs and a Modbus-related executable utility program are supplied.
- Defect 27289 patched. The Samples\FileSystem\FAT\fat_write_mbr.c standard
  sample program now explicitly disallows partitioning of an SD card flash
  memory device.
- Defect 36077 patched. The Samples\OP7200\Calib_Save_Retrieve\savecalib.c
  standard sample program's serial cable connection instructions now refer to
  the appropriate header (J10).
- Defect 38736 patched. The Samples\OP7200\LCD_TouchScreen\cal_touchscreen.c
  standard sample program now enables the backlight and sets the screen contrast
  to avoid a blank appearance.
